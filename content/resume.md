# Experience
## Self employed – Data Scientist consultant at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/uy-es) - Asesoría Económica y Actuarial del [Banco de Previsión Social](https://bps.gub.uy/) 

October 2019 - Today

I am currently migrating some actuarial and economic projections from Excel to R for the Banco de Previsión Social. It involves working side by side with the technicians to understand the models behind those projections and implement them in R, building reports using RMarkdown and building Shiny Apps for its consumption by the stakeholders (the bank directors). It also involves transferring the knowledge to the internal team.

## Self employed – Data Scientist consultant at [Pyxis](https://pyxis.com.uy/) - [Presidencia de la República](https://www.presidencia.gub.uy/)

July 2018 - December 2018

I was involved in a project for Presidencia de la República as a consultant for Pyxis. We worked on integrating its internal data with social media data, and visualizing it. I worked mostly using R, Python, MongoDB and Neo4j.

## [Idatha](www.idatha.com) – Data Scientist

August 2017 - July 2018

Idatha is a startup in Uruguay and I was its first and only Data Scientist, which means I could be very creative and I loved that! I brought a unique perspective on problem solving to the team, which meant that I was involved in almost every project of the company, and from a very early stage. 

I worked in several projects as a consultant for clients, mostly analyzing Twitter data. These projects include social media analysis for political campaigns, visualization, lead detection among others. Regarding social media in politics, I’ve been working in the presidential campaign for one of the biggest Soccer Teams in Uruguay (soccer is a big thing in Uruguay!). I used mostly R, Python and MongoDB.

## [Equifax Uruguay](https://www.equifax.uy/) – Head of Analytics Uruguay & Paraguay

November 2012 - September 2016 

I was Head of Analytics in the Data & Analytics Area of Equifax Uruguay. Uruguay is part of a Business Unit formed between Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Prior to this Business Unit, Equifax Uruguay acquired the biggest Credit Bureau in Paraguay –Informconf- and in that process I was the Analytics leader of both countries, recruiting the local Analytics team, training it and building relationships with local clients. For a brief time in 2013 I was also Acting Decision Solutions Manager for Equifax Central America, being accountable for the Analytical and Technological Support’s teams. I oversaw three operations: El Salvador, Costa Rica and Honduras, that lead me to win an award.

Part of my role was developing predictive models for credit risk assessment, marketing services –propensity, churn, segmentation, geomarketing-, income prediction, collection solutions and forecasting. These models were usually custom made, so other part of my position consisted on presales: to meet the client’s problems so I could design the best solution for each situation. I also built generic solutions such as the Paraguay Bureau Risk Score deployed in 2016 as part of the rebranding strategy of Equifax, that led me to won the 2016 ONE Equifax Award for developing the first Equifax Credit Risk Score in Paraguay.

## Universidad de la República – Academic Research and Teaching

2009 - 2013 

From 2009 until 2013 I was linked to several activities inside the University of the Republic.
I was a teacher in the School of Economics in the Computational Department and later I had a role as an Economic Historian in the Institute of Economics. In the latter I started when I won a Scholarship based on merit to be an Assistant Professor, and it ended up in a more stable position. In this Institute I was part of the Economic History Investigation Group and the Economic Development one. 
That position lead me to publish some Work Documents and Papers, as well as to participate in various congresses nationally and internationally.
