## Experience

### Self employed – Senior Data Scientist at Asesoría Económica y Actuarial area del [Banco de Previsión Social](https://bps.gub.uy/) 

June 2022 - present

Building on the economic and actuarial models I had previously migrated from Excel to R, I collaborated closely with the technical team responsible for designing the Uruguayan Social Security System reform. I implemented the different scenarios and potential changes to evaluate its short, middle and long term implications. The executive branch utilized this input to inform their final decision-making process.

I frequently engaged in various small projects and discussions aimed at problem-solving, utilizing my expertise in R, Shiny, RMarkdown, and Bookdown to automate processes. The team consistently regarded me as the go-to person for R-related tasks. Furthermore, I conducted a workshop to impart fundamental R tools to the team.

### Self employed – Senior Data Scientist at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/uy-es) - Asesoría Económica y Actuarial del [Banco de Previsión Social](https://bps.gub.uy/) 

October 2019 - February 2022

My primary project involved migrating economic and actuarial models responsible for generating projections for the Uruguayan social security system and other public retirement funds from Excel to R. I collaborated closely with the technicians to comprehend the models underpinning those projections and successfully implementing them in R. I designed, implemented, and collaborated in validating the results, successfully achieving a reduction in execution times of over 60%. The projections entailed processing records of contributors, retirees, and pensioners from BPS (Uruguayan Social Security Administration). I proposed and implemented the use of Shiny apps to visualize the results, which are now utilized by the Bank Directors. I also automated periodic reports that present projection results using RMarkdown and Bookdown.

I participated in other smaller projects, including the design and implementation of a Shiny application to detect discrepancies in the department's catalog series. Additionally, I automated the consolidation of data received from other departments, integrated it into historical series, and generated RMarkdown reports based on the processed information. During the RStudio implementation process on the BPS server, I participated in validating that the proposed solution met the department's short and medium-term requirements. 

To execute these tasks, I primarily utilized R, RStudio, Shiny, RMarkdown, Bookdown, and Excel, along with Git for version control (utilizing BPS's Corporate Gitlab).

In all instances, I provided suggestions to improve the communication of findings, particularly emphasizing visualization tools and best practices.

For the initial four months, I worked at the BPS headquarters. Since March 2020, I worked remotely by connecting to the BPS corporate network.

### Self employed – Data Scientist consultant at [Pyxis](https://pyxis.com.uy/) - [Presidencia de la República](https://www.presidencia.gub.uy/)

July 2018 - December 2018

We worked on integrating its internal data with social media data, and visualizing it. I worked mostly using R, Python, MongoDB and Neo4j.

### [Idatha](www.idatha.com) – Data Scientist

August 2017 - July 2018

Idatha is a startup in Uruguay and I was its first and only Data Scientist, which means I could be very creative and I loved that! I brought a unique perspective on problem solving to the team, which meant that I was involved in almost every project of the company, and from a very early stage. 

I worked in several projects as a consultant for clients, mostly analyzing Twitter data. These projects include social media analysis, visualization, lead detection, predictive modeling among others. I used mostly R, Python and MongoDB.

### [Equifax Uruguay](https://www.equifax.uy/) – Head of Analytics Uruguay & Paraguay

November 2012 - September 2016 

I was Head of Analytics in the Data & Analytics Area of Equifax Uruguay. Uruguay was part of a Business Unit formed between Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Prior to this Business Unit, Equifax Uruguay acquired the biggest Credit Bureau in Paraguay –Informconf- and in that process I was the Analytics leader of both countries, recruiting the local Analytics team, training it and building relationships with local clients. For a brief time in 2013 I was also Acting Decision Solutions Manager for Equifax Central America, being accountable for the Analytical and Technological Support’s teams. I oversaw three operations: El Salvador, Costa Rica and Honduras, that lead me to win an award.

Part of my role was developing predictive models for credit risk assessment, marketing services –propensity, churn, segmentation, geomarketing-, income prediction, collection solutions and forecasting. These models were usually custom made, so other part of my position consisted on presales: to meet the client’s problems so I could design the best solution for each situation. I also built generic solutions such as the Paraguay Bureau Risk Score deployed in 2016 as part of the rebranding strategy of Equifax, that led me to won the 2016 ONE Equifax Award for developing the first Equifax Credit Risk Score in Paraguay.

### Universidad de la República – Academic Research and Teaching

2009 - 2013 

I was linked to several activities inside the University of the Republic. I was a teacher in the School of Economics in the Computational Department and later I had a role as an Economic Historian in the Institute of Economics. In the latter I started when I won a Scholarship based on merit to be an Assistant Professor, and it ended up in a more stable position. In this Institute I was part of the Economic History Investigation Group and the Economic Development one. That position lead me to publish some Work Documents and Papers, as well as to participate in various congresses nationally and internationally.
