# Welcome, welcome,  welcome!

One thing my husband and I enjoy a lot is watching [*Last Week Tonight with John Oliver*](https://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver) every week. It is an HBO political talk-show that airs on Sunday nights, and we usually watch it while we have dinner sometime during the week. We love the show because it covers a huge amount of diverse topics and news from all over the world, plus we laugh a lot (bittersweet laughs mostly ü§∑üèª
‚ôÄÔ∏è ).

I think John has a fantastic sense of humor and he is a spectacular communicator, but only if you share the way he sees the world. And because he is so enthusiastic about his views, I believe it is a character you either love or hate. I suspect he (as well as the controversial topics he proposes) arouses strong feelings in people and I want to check it by analyzing the comments people leave on [his Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight) and [his Facebook ones](https://www.facebook.com/LastWeekTonight/) as well.

I've been wanting to try [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/blog/) and [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/)'s [`tidytext` package](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) for a while now, and after I read [Erin's text analysis on the Lizzie Bennet Diaries' Youtube captions](https://eringrand.github.io/lizziebennet_textmining/) I thought about giving Youtube a try üòÉ

# Fetching Youtube videos and comments

Every episode has one _main story_ and many _short stories_ that are mostly [available to watch online via Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight).

I'm using the [Youtube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/) and the [`tuber` package](https://github.com/soodoku/tuber) to get the info from Youtube (I found a bug in the `get_comment_thread` function on the CRAN version, so I recommend you use the GitHub one instead, where that is fixed). The first time you need to do some things to obtain authorization credentials so your application can submit API requests (you can follow [this guide to do so](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)). Then you just use the `tuber::yt_oauth` function that launches a browser to allow you to authorize the application and you can start retrieving information.

First I search for the Youtube channel, I select the correct one and then I retrieve the `playlist_id` that I'm going to use to fetch all videos.




```r
library(tuber)

app_id <- "####"
app_password <- "####"
yt_oauth(app_id, app_password)

search_channel <- yt_search("lastweektonight")
channel <- "UC3XTzVzaHQEd30rQbuvCtTQ"

channel_resources <- list_channel_resources(filter = c(channel_id = channel),
                                                part =  "contentDetails")

playlist_id <- channel_resources$items[[1]]$contentDetails$relatedPlaylists$uploads
```

## Fetching the videos

To get all videos I use the `get_playlist_items` function, but it only retrieve the first 50 elements. I know [soodoku](https://github.com/soodoku) is planning on implementing an argument *ala "get_all"*, but in the meantime I have to implement this myself to get all the videos (I took [more than a few ideas from Erin's script!](https://eringrand.github.io/lizziebennet_textmining/)).

I should warn you ‚ö†Ô∏è : The `tuber` package is all about lists, and not _tidy dataframes_, so I dedicate a lot of effort to tidying this data.


```r
library(dplyr)
library(tuber)
library(purrr)
library(magrittr)
library(tibble)

get_videos <- function(playlist) {
  # pass NA as next page to get first page
  nextPageToken <- NA
  videos <- {}

  # Loop over every available page
  repeat {
    vid      <- get_playlist_items(filter = c(playlist_id = playlist),
                                   page_token = nextPageToken)

    vid_id   <- map(vid$items, "contentDetails") %>%
      map_df(magrittr::extract, c("videoId", "videoPublishedAt"))

    titles   <- lapply(vid_id$videoId, get_video_details) %>%
      map("localized") %>%
      map_df(magrittr::extract, c("title", "description"))

    videos   <- videos %>% bind_rows(tibble(id          = vid_id$videoId,
                                            created     = vid_id$videoPublishedAt,
                                            title       = titles$title,
                                            description = titles$description))

    # get the token for the next page
    nextPageToken <- ifelse(!is.null(vid$nextPageToken), vid$nextPageToken, NA)

    # if no more pages then done
    if (is.na(nextPageToken)) {
      break
    }
  }
  return(videos)
}

videos <- get_videos(playlist_id)
```

Then I extract the first part from the title and description (the rest is just advertisement), and format the video's creation date,


```r
library(stringr)

videos <- videos %>%
  mutate(short_title = str_match(title, "^([^:]+).+")[,2],
         short_desc  = str_match(description, "^([^\n]+).+")[,2],
         vid_created = as.Date(created)) %>%
  select(-created)
```


Lets take a look at the videos.


```r
library(DT)
datatable(videos[, c(4:6)], rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(pageLength = 5)) %>% 
  formatStyle(c(1:3), `font-size` = '15px')
```

## Fetching the comments

Now I get the comments for every video. I make my own functions for the same reason as before. The function `get_video_comments` retrieves comments from a given `video_id`, receiving the `n` parameter as the maximum of comments we want.


```r
get_video_comments <- function(video_id, n = 5) {
  nextPageToken <- NULL
  comments <- {}

  repeat {
    com <- get_comment_threads(c(video_id  = video_id),
                               part        = "id, snippet",
                               page_token  = nextPageToken,
                               text_format = "plainText")

    for (i in 1:length(com$items)) {
      com_id      <- com$items[[i]]$snippet$topLevelComment$id
      com_text    <- com$items[[i]]$snippet$topLevelComment$snippet$textDisplay
      com_video   <- com$items[[i]]$snippet$topLevelComment$snippet$videoId
      com_created <- com$items[[i]]$snippet$topLevelComment$snippet$publishedAt

      comments    <- comments %>% bind_rows(tibble(video_id    = com_video,
                                                   com_id      = com_id,
                                                   com_text    = com_text,
                                                   com_created = com_created))
      if (nrow(comments) == n) {
        break
      }

      nextPageToken <- ifelse(!is.null(com$nextPageToken), com$nextPageToken, NA)
    }

    if (is.na(nextPageToken) | nrow(comments) == n) {
      break
    }
  }
  return(comments)
}
```

The function `get_videos_comments` receives a vector of `video_id`s and returns `n` comments for every video, using the previous `get_video_comments` function. Then I remove empty comments, join with the video information and remove videos with less than 100 comments.


```r
get_videos_comments <- function(videos, n = 10){
  comments <- pmap_df(list(videos, n), get_video_comments)
}

raw_yt_comments <- get_videos_comments(videos$id, n = 300)

yt_comments <- raw_yt_comments %>%
  filter(com_text != "") %>% 
  left_join(videos, by = c("video_id" = "id")) %>%
  group_by(short_title) %>%
  mutate(n = n(),
         com_created = as.Date(com_created)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(n >= 100)
```



And looking at the first rows we can already see some of that passion I was talking about üò≥


```r
datatable(head(yt_comments[, c(7, 9, 3)], 30), rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(pageLength = 5)) %>% 
  formatStyle(c(1:3), `font-size` = '15px')
```

# Most used words and sentiment

In the _tidy text_ world, a [tidy dataset](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html) is a table with one-token-per-row. I start by tidying the `yt_comments` dataframe, and removing the stop words (the `stop_word` dictionary is already included in the `tidytext` package).


```r
library(tidytext)

tidy_yt_comments <- yt_comments %>%
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(word, com_text) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word")
```

## Positive and Negative words in comments

I'm using the `bing` lexicon to evaluate the emotion in the word, that categorizes it into _positive_ and _negative_. I join the words in the `tidy_yt_comments` dataset with the sentiment on the `bing` lexicon, and then count how many times each word appears. 

So let's find out the most used words in the comments!


```r
library(ggplot2)

yt_pos_neg_words <- tidy_yt_comments %>%  
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"), by = "word") %>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, nn)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, nn, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red2", "green3")) +
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = "free_y") +
  ylim(0, 2500) +
  labs(y = NULL, x = NULL) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal()
```

There is a lot of strong words here! And I'm pretty sure this [`trump` _positive_ word](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trump) we are seeing is not quite the same [_Trump_ John has been talking about non stop for the last two years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml5qULGjbno)... and not precisely in a positive way...  I could include this word in a `custom_stop_words` dataframe, but I'm going leave it like that for now.

Also... not sure why `funny` is in the `negative` category ü§î I know it can be used as _weird_ or something like that, but I think this happens because I'm not a native English speaker ü§∑üèª
‚ôÄÔ∏è

Are there more positive or negative words?


```r
tidy_yt_comments %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"), by = "word") %>% 
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(sentiment = reorder(sentiment, nn)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(sentiment, nn)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = sentiment), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("green3", "red2")) +
  ylab(NULL) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal()
```

Definitely more negative than positive words. OK.

## More sentiments in comments

There is a different lexicon, the `nrc` one, that classifies the words into more categories: two _sentiments_: _positive_ and _negative_, and eight _basic emotions_: _anger_, _anticipation_, _disgust_, _fear_, _joy_, _sadness_, _surprise_, and _trust_. Let's check what we find!


```r
tidy_yt_comments  %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"), by = "word") %>% 
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, nn)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, nn, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = "free_y") +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab(NULL) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal()
```

OK... a few comments here. 

* `john` is considered a _negative_ word associated with _disgust_... So I checked and found that [it means either a toilet or a prostitute's client](https://www.google.com.uy/search?q=john+meaning&oq=john+meaning&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5413j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), so now I get it üöΩ Either way, I'm going to include it in the `custom_stop_words` dataframe because it is a word so frequent that makes every other word disproportionate.

* `trump` again is considered a _positive_ word, associated with _surprise_ (no doubt about the _surprise_ element for both the word and the character though).

There are very controversial classifications on this `nrc` lexicon, especially with the terms `black`, classified as _negative_ (and _sadness_) and `white` as _positive_ (and _joy_, _anticipation_ and _trust_). I don't like this at all...

I also have some comments:

* `goverment` is _negative_ while `president` is _positive_. Just caught my attention.

* `money`: üí∞ what is wrong with this word?! Apparently it is a very confusing one, because it is linked with _positive_ sentiment and _anticipation_, _joy_, _surprise_ and _trust_ emotions, but also with _anger_ ü§î

Anyway, these are side comments because they are about the lexicon (_or the human nature!_) and not this analysis. Bottom line: I don't like this lexicon üòí

What is the most present sentiment/emotion?

According to this lexicon, there are more positive than negative words! The opposite of what we found using the `bing` lexicon. The thing about this one is that allows us to analyze other sentiments as well. But of course I'm not going to use it anymore üò§

# Most used n-grams

Other interesting thing to do is find the most common [_n-grams_](https://www.tidytextmining.com/ngrams.html) (threads of n amount of words that tend to co-occur).


```r
yt_comments %>%
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(five_gram, com_text, token = "ngrams", n = 5) %>%
  count(five_gram, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%

_"how is this still a"_ and _"is this still a thing"_ of course ring a bell for those of us who watch the show, since it has a section called _"How is this still a thing?"_ questioning certain traditions or things that for some reason seemed adequate at some point in time, but now are totally absurd. Like [voting for the US Presidential Elections on Tuesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0bMfS-_pjM), or [the _swimsuit issue_ of the Sports Illustrated magazine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8QNDRbjong) üôÑ

And I find it shocking that they mocked that Francois Hollande doesn't believe in God. In France, it is very common not to believe in God. probably 90% of the people I know don't believe in God and for us it's an evidence. We find people that do believe in God, weird. Even though he is a terrible president, I do agree with him on that. I find it weird that they emphasise at the End \"A president who doesn't think God exists\" and like that's an evidence. Because up until now, there has been NO proof of God's existence. Yet people still believe it. But what's weird is that if tomorrow I said \"I have aliens spelling in my house\" you would be like \"WTF!\". It's just someone invented one day because at the time they didn't know how life was made and why is this and why is that, so they said \"only god has the answer\" yet now we have the answers to most things yet people still believe in God. America is the country with he most people that believe in God which is crazy. Only 3% of the people in the USA don't believe in God and in France it's probably the opposite. And choosing the christian religion, honestly, that's like the worst religion you could ever choose. You guys believe in Heaven and Hell and all that shit that's 100000% fake. You teach your kids terrible things. If you have to choose your religion, just believe in God and don't follow stupid rules. Or if you REALLY want to have a religion, choose Jewish, it's the most realistic one and their rules are way more down to the ground. I feel like the Bible was written by a Jew that took Crystal Meth by accident and thought that all that he saw was true and wrote it in a book which was written in a year where everyone believed what everyone said so they published the book, it then became a religion and people are transmitting this brainwashing bullshit to their kids and making crazy God psychopaths. If God exists, which I am questioning a lot, I don't think he needs everyone to suck his balls that much, I mean, would you like it if 3-5 Billion people (deducting people that believe in God) were sucking on your balls all day in exchange for you  making effort for each and everyone to help solve your dept issues or your couple problems? I am pretty sure you would commit suicide, so if God existed once, he probably committed suicide.

Just to be clear My family is not Jewish, They are \"Catholic\" meaning that's what they were essentially but nobody cares about religion or believes in God in this family because we all know that it's all invented. I could honestly compare God to Santa Clause because instead of him being a guy that gives you free presents, he is supposed to heal all of ur problems in exchange for prayers.

Just like I suspected, this is one very long concatenation of the word _"great"_. This guy is a very, _very_ enthusiastic atheist who is referring to a very old ancestor, so it doesn't count for this analysis.


# Moving on... 

## Sentiment Analysis on comments

Similar to what I did for every word, now I join the words in the `tidy_yt_comments` dataset with the sentiment on the `bing` lexicon, and then count how many _positive_ and _negative_ words are in every comment. Then compute the `sentiment` as `positive` - `negative`, to finally join this to the `yt_comment` dataset. 


```r
library(tidyr) 

yt_comment_sent <- tidy_yt_comments  %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"), by = "word") %>% 
  count(com_id, sentiment) %>%
  spread(sentiment, nn, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  left_join(yt_comments, by = "com_id") %>% 
  arrange(sentiment) 
```

The longer the comment, the higher potential for higher sentiment. Let's take a look at the extremes. The most negative comments according to the `bing` lexicon are:


```r
datatable(head(yt_comment_sent[, c(10, 12, 6)], 30), 
          rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(pageLength = 1)) %>% 
  formatStyle(c(1:3), `font-size` = '15px')
```

Yeah, again- go figure!","I am in the 19%, but I am not the rude type, but respect the views of all people and wish to engage in the discussion.  The abortion doctor said there are the same exact risks to the woman's body from natural progression of pregnancy and childbirth, as with elective abortion, except increased risk of breast cancer - not.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  I heard that giving birth reduces a woman's risk of breast cancer compared to never being pregnant.  There is a benefit of full term birth &amp; delivery.  Nursing a baby also reduces risk of breast cancer too.  Hormones really do have an effect on breast cancer risk.   A woman's body was not designed to handle the sudden loss of a healthy baby from forced removal early in the pregnancy.  It is not natural for her body to have to cope with the huge level of pregnancy hormones like that.  There is an effect on her health long term.   There is an increased risk of breast cancer from use of the hormonal contraceptive pill and IUD as well.  Hormones matter to breast health.  Breasts and uterus are linked together, understandably so.  Their purpose is more than just for fun or art.  When a baby nurses on mom, her uterus contracts, which early on after delivery is kind of painful.  We've had 4 full term deliveries of healthy children, and one stillbirth of 14 weeks gestational age that we didn't know had died until 17 weeks at the appointment.  I felt different and knew something was wrong before the doctor told me there was no heartbeat anymore.  We had heard it weakly the month before, most difficult heartbeat to find of the 5 pregnancies.  I knew then something was off about that pregnancy, and by the next week our son had died.  My pregnancy hormones reduced naturally, not by shock method of one day alive baby and then no baby.  But the hormones weren't done.  My milk came in a little the next day.  I hadn't expected that.  Hormones matter.  The uterus is VERY connected to breast health and cancer risk.  In fact, I used to work for an OB/GYN.  The risk of cervical cancer and other reproductive cancers is higher in post abortive women.  And the risk of the cervix being damaged by abortion is higher, and they have a higher risk of the cervix not being able to stay properly closed tight during full term pregnancy.  The science shows higher risks for women's health after elective abortion.  A waiting period is a good idea to really research ALL the risks, physically and emotionally, to make a well informed decision.  Getting an abortion is NOT a minor medical decision like wart removal.   Suicide and drug abuse and alcohol abuse are higher risks for post abortive women and men.   \n\nAlso, I'd like to ask about the sharp object inserted in through her unnaturally expanded cervix to suction out the baby in pieces.  Is there a risk of perforation of the uterine wall and the associated bleeding and infection?  Does an OB/GYN doctor routinely expand the cervical opening to insert a sharp ended tube into the uterus?  If not, how can the exact same risks exist between abortion and carrying the baby to term and delivering her? or him?\n\nI'd also like to share that the legal abortion situation makes it EASIER for incest pregnancies to be hidden, as the evidence is easily disposed of, and the father or stepfather or whoever can intimidate the minor daughter to keep quiet and claim it was a boyfriend who did it.  Most guilty men in the family would not force a more dangerous illegal abortion, even if some would.  Most of the time the guy would be forced to be caught red handed.   Now, most of them can get away with it in secret.  Why not?  Just have her blame a mysterious boyfriend, like the father who got his teen daughter pregnant 6 times and they had all the babies, and she just told  mom it was various boyfriends that broke up with her.  At least he was eventually caught and jailed.  I saw this pathetic child abuser on video, Dr. Phil's show I think years ago, and he actually blamed his daughter!!!!   Well, he had trained her to like his affections, so technically she COULD have seduced him well after the initial rapes she was agianst.  In time though, and with good enough excuses and fear, girls can be tricked into lying and even abortion, depending on the man's desire to care for the children he creates, or not.\n\nI  have heard it's best to get a 2nd opinion, or even 3rd, when making significant decisions, and to not trust only the people selling a product or service.  It's good to hear of testimonials from satisfied and unsatisfied customers.  It's good to sleep on it when making financial purchase decisions, so there is nothing inhumane about requiring a person considering a major medical decision to think about it for 24-72 hours.  Time to gather more information, to get those 2nd and 3rd opinions, from those that agree or disagree, the full range of info available, and that takes time.   An impatient emotional decision got these ladies into this mess (most of the time), and it shouldn't require another impatient emotional decision to fix it.   \n\nI heard that Steven Tyler of Aerosmith had some serious mental problems and violence issues and drug abuse problems to numb the pain of his emotional decision to end the life of his first son.  He actually witnessed the abortion by saline solution injected by needle into his girlfriend's uterus through the belly.  He wanted to be there for her, and was not afraid to be a part of the whole thing.  No liberal media is talking about how the men feel about their child.  Men ARE affected.  I didn't know until last month, when I read this book, \"ABORTION: The Ultimate Exploitation of Women\" by Brian Fisher......free download available.   https://www.humancoalition.org/kba1/_pdf/abortion-the-ultimate-exploitation-of-women.pdf\n\nLegal abortion was started by white supremacists mainly to keep the population of blacks and minorities down.  It has worked, still is.  Look at the statistics of who gets the most abortions, and where the majority of the clinics are strategically located.  Planned parenthood claims they are all about women's health, but do they provide the full range of pregnancy services that poor women need?  Such as if they want the baby but can't afford to go to a full service OB/GYN that doesn't perform abortions?   If the abortion clinic doctors had hospital admitting services and wiser hallways at the women's health clinics, they could also offer pregnancy and birth services to poor women in the inner cities.   Those new laws only seem irrational to liberals because they think women's health clinics to poor women should not include the full range of obstetrical services that the middle and upper class have access to.  Why can't you go to a Planned Parenthood women's health center and get pregnancy vitamins and care and birth care too?  They get breast exams and pregnancy tests, why not the rest of the care too?  Why can't their favorite people at Planned Parenthood clinics be happy for them when they finally get pregnant wanting the baby and continue to see familiar faces throughout their pregnancy, birth, and post-natal care?   Continuity of care is best for patient health.   If the abortion goes wrong, the patient would be happier and better off to have her abortion doctor help her in the hospital she gets admitted to, rather than having to deal with a different doctor she doesn't know, that is new to understanding her specific body and personality.  Why don't  abortion doctors want to also help them in the hospital if needed?  That makes no sense to me.  When I break things, I like to help fix it, and feel better and so does the person that I inconvenienced with my mistake.\n\nThe abortion doctor speaking to that sitting group of women, about abortion risks and comparison with full term live birth, he seemed kind of emotional, rather than plain speaking professional.  He didn't explain his comments with scientific talk and data, but rather introductory type statements that weren't backed up with statistics and hormonal &amp; physical science.  I just don't see equal risk of sharp ended vacuum extraction through a forced open cervix as equally risky with pregnancy where no sharp ended tube is inserted into the uterus.   It is easy enough to Google risk of perforation of uterine wall by an abortion tool.  I'll do that now.  Numbers don't lie.","I am a physician who is worried about the opposite problem, the new government message that real pain doesn't hurt, and that everyone who takes opiates will become an addict.

Before the 4th surgery I was in the most unbelievable pain I've ever had and was on massive doses of morphine (my insurance made oxycontin more expensive, and an equivalent dose of morphine seemed to give me a little more relief).  In general, the physicians treating me were far more likely to make me suffer for quite a while before any pain medication was prescribed, despite the fact that I've never had an addiction for medication other than coffee, and had no other risk factors for addiction.  As a physician, the stigma I knew came with these narcotics was emotionally painful for me, as well; however, I understood my own doctor's caution because I was always thorough and cautious when prescribing opioids for my patients; I trained at Mayo and learned even back in 1990 that you start low and go slow, that people with other risk factors are more likely to become addicted... and that pain, real pain, is still often undertreated.  I honestly believe I never caused a patient to become an addict, and did my best to help those patients I knew to be addicts.  Okay, so after my last surgery, the pain barely lessened.  I got a neurostimulator placed and was able to get down to half the dose of morphine I was on, but I've been on that same dose for 5 years, now.  I am physically dependent--I got a \"stomach flu\" once and couldn't keep my morphine down, and went into withdrawal (which was thoroughly humiliating).  But that's not the problem; the problem is this stable dose does not relieve my pain anymore.  I have a tolerance--which is predictable after 5 years on the same dose of opioid.  This year, my state legalized marijuana for chronic intractable pain.  I've done the research--and my pain specialist confirms--marijuana CBD/THS 50/50 would likely provide a great deal of pain relief.  But the pain clinic's policy is that I will have to wean off all narcotics if I get on the medical marijuana program, despite the fact that there is no contraindication to taking both, despite the fact that I would likely finally need less of the morphine for the same level of pain control, and despite the fact that the marijuana dispenser (the pain clinic does NOT prescribe marijuana despite the fact that it is legal and their physicians think it would help me!) tells me it is very unlikely that marijuana alone would not likely be sufficient to completely cover the pain.  In addition, the marijuana is very expensive when obtained at the dispensary.  You have no idea how tempting it is for me to become a criminal just to obtain pain relief; I could get the marijuana cheaply on the streets, use it in addition to (hopefully less) of the morphine I need to take until 6 weeks before my pain clinic visit (because it takes 6 weeks for the THC metabolite to leave the system, although the pain relief is gone withing hours of use).  Because I think I might get a couple of weeks of pain relief, with a non-addictive drug that does not increase (and might decrease) the potential for overdose (although that is null for me since I never take it except as prescribed and can't even tell I'm on it any more until I go too long between doses).  Long story short?  Fuck our stupid legislators and fuck the stupid business policy of the only pain clinic available in our area, fuck the stigma... but I still can't bring myself to start doing something criminal at age 62, and I don't want to risk losing a medication that at least keeps me from killing myself because it helps a little, for a medication I don't know for sure will help.  And my biggest fuck you is for the candy man doctors that just gave opioids out like water, they were never real doctors in the first place; but neither are those that worry about the government telling them they are suspect if they treat real pain.","Holy shit, Oliver has really come into his own. This was a frigin torpedo, shot broadside on the (\"Republican fascist ship of fools\"), and the (back stabbing blue dog Democrat apparatchiks) who stabbed Bernie, and the progressive base in the back. Way to go John. Don't know if I could have kicked ass as well as you just did ?  F_ _ _ Donald Trump any way. \nI was very discouraged when Jon Stewart left the scene, because his commentaries were so brutal, so intellectually, classically biting, funny, and hurled with deadly accuracy. It gives me hope, that  there are  many more brutally honest, feisty, rebellious, \"hilarious\" free thinking soldiers in the fight against (World Wide Corporate Fascism). \n\nWake up my fellow Americans, and prepare for the fight of your lives, because \"this is not normal\". Try to imagine the disbelief, the shock, the horror, dread, confusion, pain and suffering of our parent's / grand parent's generation at the dawn of WWII. They had no choice, but to face the life, and death struggle against totalitarian fascism that had a bayonet at their throats. It was only a single lifetime ago, a microsecond in historical time, that the (collective psychosis) of another group of corporate fascist lunatics drove the civilization to madness, and mass murder. 60,000,000 died world wide. \n\nThe very same rhetoric, the same types of personalities, the same types of propaganda, the same barbaric inhumane proposals. It's the same completely arrogant leadership that believes they are kings, not public servants here with us today. They will loot the treasury, and rape American consumers, and taxpayers. Trumps cabinet, and Jackals like Ryan, and McConnell are the perfect whore examples. The fascist control of all three branches of our government will result in a catastrophic breakdown of law, order, functionality, social cohesion, militarization on a vast scale,  environmental catastrophe, more unnecessary wars of profiteering and barbarism, leading to more terrorists, and civil collapse. We like our ancestors must prepare to storm the beaches, in a new Iwo Jima, a new Omaha Beach, metaphorically speaking, at least for now. We must prepare to crush the enemy with the same necessary ferocity that was required to kill the fascist beast once before. Now it's kill or be killed as the saying goes, \"self defense\". Sounds crazy to a generation that has no memory of WWII, no experience with the insanity, of global war and the death sadness, and horrendous suffering that befalls the most innocent in all wars. Don't be lulled into complacency. Roosevelt said  ( \"The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself, nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror, which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.\" } The fascists do not own the people's house. They will be evicted, and banished when the people have a mind to remove them soon.","The State of Kansas regarding my tone in voicing my emotions regarding medical malpractice caused sepsis and the abandonment of an emergency medical condition and diagnostic test ordered by an orthopedic specialist interfered with under threats of arrest acts legal mal practice breach of contract fraud slander.

How crazy you have to be to say that facts are racist. \n\nPlease go and look for some normal people on YT or somewhere else, look at numbers and opinions and learn(educate yourself). First go and type Stefan Molyneaux. Watch his videos and you will see a lot of interesting FACTS. He is about facts and not about crazy liberal mantras. And for americans: watch Colin Flaherty and Tommy Sotomayor(TNNRaw; TNNRaw2). Watch it and educate yourself. Johnny is funny; he have a lot of good stuff(for example: auto lending, doping, cigarettes, legal drugs, scharlatan dr.oz, scientific studies, lead, credit reports, obamacare, north dakota, ...). He and his associates have done good research with facts in some areas; but you can just see that Johnny is a liberal democrat(ok, he would be if he could vote; still is) and is pushing their agenda no matter what. Just for example: DNC and RNC conventions. He pointed to some facts but he is totaly oblivious to others(watch Stefan Molynaux intervierw with Mike Cernovich about those two conventions - you will learn a lot).

He is a savy political and social commentator. Again, please watch his stuff - you will learn a lot. \n\nAgain: Colin Flaherty, Tommy Sotomayor, Dr.of Common Sense, Stefan Molyneaux. Please watch their videos - you will educate yourself to a level of a decent human being. Because if you are crazy liberal democrat femi-nazi SJW.

The men who fought and risked everything to make us a free country and drafted the Constitution are fucking rolling in their graves at how greedy and heartless this country truly is. It is disgusting how these filthy rich 1% Break the backs and destroy families lives just to clear a couple more million into their own personal bank accounts. I'm sure everyone remembers how the banking system got so corrupt that the government had to Shell out billions and billions to save them, and none of them did any fucking prison time. Those corrupt corporate bankers and CEO's committed some of the most heinous and disgusting financial crimes in history, literally stealing millions of people's homes that they owned, putting millions and millions of Americans, ( majority of whom were senior citizens who already owned their homes) out on the street. Then these lowlife scumfuck pieces of human garbage took the money the government gave them, and proceeded to pay themselves millions in bonuses and lavish retreats to some of the most exotic places on Earth, when they actually deserved to be rotting in a prison. It fucking turns my stomach that these corporate crooks robbed the American public for billions of dollars for years, and then when the government bailed them out, they used the money to pay themselves millions more. How is it possible that these scumfucks robbed this country blind for years aren't in prison, but the average American who they robbed for their life savings and their homes and have nothing left, so they decided enough is enough and went in and robbed one of the corrupt banks branches are doing 20 years in prison. I truly believe that it is far beyond time for another American revolution. These 1% fat cats think they are untouchable and That they can do whatever they want. We are the 99%. We as the 99% need to storm these scumfucks mansions and country clubs and string them all the fuck up. Enough is enough America, we need to do something about this bullshit. How is it that we allow this tiny portion of the population to continually make billions off of the backs of us decent Americans. This is unacceptable. No longer should these scumfuck billionaires to do whatever they want without the fear of being held accountable. And the Cherry on top of it all is that the American people went and elected the motherfucking poster boy of greed and corporate favoritism as president of the country. What is wrong with the American public? Are we really that weak and ignorant that we are just going to sit back and let 1% of the population rape and steal from us, and then sit in their mansions and laugh about how they are continuing to fuck the rest of the country over with zero repercussions? Fuck that, and fuck corporate America. Everyone always says that this country would fall apart without big banks and corporate America, but I say that's bullshit. Why do we need to keep making billionaires more billions, as day after day this countries greatest cities are being reduced to 3rd world status. We don't need the Koch brothers or any other billionaires, they need us. No one needs a billion fucking dollars, period. The new Constitution of this country is fucking all about greed. It is far beyond time that we as a country said that this is enough, and we need to start holding these scumfuck motherfuckers accountable for destroying this country. I would love to see an angry mob storming Bank of America and Goldman Sachs headquarters, and would relish the sight of their CEO's and their board of directors flying out the windows of their skyscrapers and splating on the street.","Alabama Code Title 13A.

The most disgusting fact in that whole scenario is that the taxpayers give this scumfuck billionaire owner hundreds of millions of dollars, and then they don't get any of the revenue that their shiny new stadium generates. This fucking country has it so ass backwards it's sickening.

When the fuck is the American public gonna wake up and say enough is enough. I've heard that something like 10% of the population has over 90% of the wealth. How we as Americans just sit back and think that's okay is fucking infuriating. All these Billionaire scumfucks are living like kings and are more worried about how they are gonna make their next couple of million while entire cities and populations are falling apart, and decent hard working families are struggling to keep a roof over their families head and trying to make sure that they can fucking eat. Then the Cherry on top of this countries ignorance, we go ahead and elect a billionaire scumfuck piece of shit as president.

Sometimes I think badly of satire (but love it to death overall) when it claims people are being hurt and something bad's afoot. It's April Fool's, people should have the small mental ability to know pranks are around and should be skeptical. Don't excuse/rationalize mindlessness. Pranks can be harmful, sure, but that's very rare and not a reason to command your audience to not do any pranks. If we accept weakness of character and emotional fragility we perpetuate it and it's detrimental to our collective well-being.\n\nAbstractly, if someone is honest and says \"I don't find you attractive\" the reaction shouldn't be anything like \"OMG RUDE. BAD PERSON.\" (Or any related cases like a prank that may offend someone.) That's the kind of \"emotional stupidity\" (\"human defensive-survival weakness\") being fostered here; Political correctness is strongly related, a joke is sometimes just a joke, we shouldn't be worried about people making a big deal out of nothing. We have a narcissistic addiction to suffering, playing the victim for the moral high-ground, etc, which is also related.\n\nSome conservatives are racist/sexist/etc and deserve negative publicity which may ultimately help America, so if that's \"political correctness\" then in context that's good, but overall, to claim something is offensive therefore it shouldn't be done/talked about is often very bad. Take Islam for example. Most middle-eastern countries' population's majorities condone brutal, anti-human-rights sexist and violent Sharia law where the punishment for abandoning Islam is death by law. (To say they wear religious clothing by choice when not wearing it has extremely severe consequences is absolutely ridiculous btw.) But saying that can get me branded as an insensitive bigot. Ad hominems are common in \"discourse\"... Being tolerant of intolerance is pitiful and bad to do, usually.

People wouldn't have to go to the cartel , they would just have to go to the pot store.

You can hate on recreational use all you want, but marijuana and heroin are not equated. Along with this classification, marijuana can't be studied properly and fully.\n\nLet's also like at the concept of freedom. See, it's a plant , that causes way less damage then legal alcohol, and you're telling me someone shouldn't be free to make their own choice? \n\nA lot of people look at its negative affects. \nMarijuana doesn't leave you brain dead. A lot of marijuana users can still function. They can talk, eat, hold jobs , make money etc, so what's the problem? so bringing in the lower IQ, lower drive argument is pointless. And for the exceptionally productive pot users, why should they have to suffer because of the ones who aren't as productive? It's like school. They teach you all this unnecessary bullshit that won't help you do basic stuff as an adult. All the things that happen post school are way different then school stuff itself. I can take someone's order, organize shelves, become a politician, create my own business , flip a house. Most assignments in school are to specific , detailed and useless.Most pot users can do that basic stuff, so what's the problem , especially if they are happy? I don't take peoples \" academic \" arguments against weed seriously.\n\nMarijuana criminalization also has a negative affect on prisons. Arresting someone for months to tears for marijuana, are you kidding me! Ruining their life over a plant that doesn't cause nearly as much significant harm as legal alcohol? Yeah, over crowding prisons with low level marijuana \" offenders \" is complete bullshit. People who support that kind of law and system I call them sick, evil, sinister, disgusting. Anything negative, if you're that person that's against it like that, I lose some respect for you. \nAll these issues are brought to light as kids. Most off the marijuana haters have either never smoked it, use one example to judge everyone, or were brainwashed by their parents and can't let go.\n\nThere is such a thing called regulation , if marijuana haters have ever heard of it. Pot supporters aren't saying no regulation. Just regulate it, make a law concerning the age you can smoke it, and things will be fine. \n\nI'm not gonna completely avoid marijuana haters , since I have them in my family.\nBut I can say.... that I respect pot haters a little less. Well... respect less... dislike more... hold a grudge... you get it.\nThe hardcore haters and people who try to attack it, I call them sick, evil, deranged, sinister, and... evil times 10. \nWill never give up my morals to these sorry asses.\n\nHopefully people will change over time. States are starting to understand. In fact, my state has a marijuana related bill being put through and discussed with legislators.\n \nTo all you marijuana supporters, we are almost there. Don't give up the fight. A  beautiful movement is taking place. We just have to keep fighting with all our courage and might to get to our goal: legalization.","What I'm about to describe is a real case from New Zealand.\n\nA 350 lb Samoan dude with a blonde Afro stole a car with an infant in the backseat from a gas station while the mother was paying inside. The gas station had him on closed circuit tv (since he's the most recognizable guy on the planet) and called the cops. The cops found him walking the street without the car and no infant. They brought him in for questioning, and he refused to tell them where the car or the baby were on this 110 degree day. So there's an infant about to die of heat exhaustion in an unknown location, the mother is hysterical in the next room, they've already tried coercion, trickery, and making a deal.... none of it worked..... and your now looking this dude in the face, and he's too scared, selfish and stupid to give up the necessary information and sacrifice MAYBE 6 months of freedom for petty theft to save the life of an innocent infant.\n\nNow.\n\nIf you think you're above the fray..... or morally sophisticated.....letting an infant die of heat exhaustion..... rather than lay hands on that simple negligent fuck.... you're a morally reprehensible buffoon.\n\nSmacking someone around IS TORTURE. Physically defending the otherwise defenseless IS TORTURE. Defending yourself against an attack, by definition, IS TORTURE. Torture is simply making someone uncomfortable as to make them give you information, or prevent further unnecessary harm. \n\nTorture can be likened to self defense. Sometimes in a dark alley it's necessary, but you shouldn't go around putting anyone in a rear naked choke. It should be safe, legal, and rare.\n\nAnd as much as I love Oliver, it's simply not true that torture doesn't work. It doesn't work ALWAYS. It may only work in very specific circumstances.... but it does sometimes work.","There are more important issues in this world than distracting humanity with lies about government, politics, money, entertainment. All of that is the same weak-minded, inhuman, unjust and evil creatures that has a generational cycle of raping humans, stealing their children, blinding their children, raping their children and then getting rich and popular from the blind and ignorant puppets they create from our misery. You all destroyed our world. You're weak creatures that rely on slavery and human blindness to exist. People are real, people don't rely on slaves, but cowards like you would tell the world it's people because you always have been a weak and cowardly race. What would you things be without slaves and mind control and weapons? Nothing. It is humans that are gods, what the elites, the rich, the powerful, and the rest of you lanky monsters are is cowards who hide behind illusions. You're all having tantrums because your sheep are infested with microbes that protect us, as we should be, and you all lie about it and deny it and distract humanity with more lies and entertainment. You are not humans and if you had anything to be proud of about it, you'd come right out and say you're not. Most people today are either a mix because you do rape people, or are completely enslaved mentally, because you are weak and cowardly and need slavery to survive. Just as you're all incapable of truth and honesty because you're really disgusting creatures who refuse to free minds.","Look at Europe for a forecast. Merkel flung open those borders open.

We must always find the truthful answer as to WHY. \nWHY, WHY, WHY? WHY did our government invade Iraq, thereby destablizing the Middle East in the first place? Why did our government, cause millions of people in the Middle East to lose their families, homes and way of life? Why did Obama create ISIS? \nWhy did Obama champion for gays and transgenders, only to have his pal, Hillary, allow unknown masses of people into our country, whose culture is to kill gays and Transgenders? Hard as I try, I can't think of a reason. Can you?\nWhy is our government, fighting Trump; hell bent, on getting us and our children killed, raped and abused, by people, who our own government, tortured, killed off families, and made homeless for some bullshit reasons in the past?

The purpose of the death penalty is to kill someone that \"deserves\" to be executed for their crimes¬†or¬†because it is deemed they are not worth the money to imprison them. I don't know anyone that does supports the death penalty that uses \"It is a detterent\" as an argument. It seems like one of those easily dismissible¬†arguments that¬†the opposition makes up, so¬†they can focus¬†the discussion onto it instead of the actual arguments used in favour of the death penalty.¬†\n\nAs of the money issue:\nThe death penalty in the form of a lethal injection is indeed very expensive. But it's also not a¬†nice way to go, at all.¬†The¬†convict is generally shown to the media and gets to watch TV while it happens. The injection doesn't work instantly, so the convict is basically waiting to die, the entire process being unnecessarily drawn out. This is not a nice way of killing someone. \n\nA bullet through the head, fired by a machine that cannot miss (barrel basically put right in front of a part of the head where is shot is fatal), is far faster, far cheaper and is, if aimed properly, nearly guaranteed to instantly kill the convict. Indeed, I said nearly: There are exceptions. Very, very rare exceptions. But the lethal injection also has exceptions. All humans react differently to drugs. And let's not forget: There is very little¬†chance for error when using this gun system. The only thing that can go wrong is the gun not firing, which is easily fixed. Human error is taken out of the equation entirely.\n\nAgain, I am not saying the death penalty should be legal. I do believe that the risk of killing an innocent is a very strong argument against it. But it is also the only real argument against¬†the death penalty.","I've had the misfortune to go to a psych ward twice, and it was absolutely horrific. I'm not sure if my experience was so bad because I was extremely anxious at the time, but I think it was just awful. Though I don't remember too much, I do remember everyone making fun of my illness, staff and patients alike, as well as spreading misinformation about it. One staff told me that the reason I was there was because I'm a little brat who didn't get their way. We also had no privacy. Maybe twice a week were there security guards manhandling a person and putting sedation into their necks. The patient would then be thrown into a small room with a plastic window and nothing more, sometimes for days at a time. They would scream for help, begging to be let out... They had no privacy whatsoever.\nThe \"treatment\" came in packets and sessions that didn't focus around actual treatment. The packets themselves were incredibly biased; the eating disorder packets were a barrage of facts about women only, and had activities focused around women only. The two men who had to read these felt ashamed of themselves. I myself got no treatment for a premeditated illness (Crohn's) And was ignored. I desperately needed my infusion, which comes every two months. I get my infusion in the same building, but on a different floor, so they didn't let me get it for two weeks. Combine that with medication they made me take and I didn't have enough strength to sit up, so I couldn't go to the dining hall and eat. My weight dropped below 100 lbs. \nThe doctors saw my immobility as moodiness and took it as an excuse to keep me there longer. Though we were told we'd get a meeting with a counselor every day, the meetings didn't even last a minute. There were three doctors: one was completely apathetic, the other was nice enough but was new and uneducated on the rules, and my longest meeting with the final one was 17 seconds, I believe. The primary doctor (The apathetic one) lied on my files to keep me there longer, writing about moodiness, a suicide attempt while in the building (which never happened), self harm while in the building (Never happened), and anger. They never addressed the actual problems I had and even went as far as to smile when telling me, \"there is no chance you will go home before going to long term.\"\nNeedless to say, even after I've been out for more than a year, I have constant nightmares and paranoid anxiety about having to go back, to the point that I'll sometimes burst into tears when driving past the hospital...\nAmerica, fix it.

This system is broken, and things need to be done...","When the tobacco companies brainwashed millions of people into believing it was their right to smoke and the government should stay out of people‚Äôs business, most Americans smoked and thought nothing wrong with it.¬† The main reason why abortion is legal is because people believe that their tax dollars are paying to support poor people who have children.¬† The government figured out tobacco was bad for people, regardless of what the tobacco companies and their billions of dollars said.¬† So, the government started to make it illegal to smoke in restaurants, bars, workplaces, etc..¬† Now 82 percent of the people don‚Äôt smoke.¬† When people start to wake up the fact that abortion is premeditated, first-degree baby murder, that there is a God in heaven fully capable of bringing fire down to have the 310,000,000 Americans destroyed, because they want to murder children, it‚Äôs a matter of national security to make abortion illegal.¬† Even if you don‚Äôt believe in God, the government does, they have information, you don‚Äôt know.

Death penalty does nothing to deter crime, it doesn't bring the dead back to life, and most importantly it sets a model of killing by the very state that is trying to prevent its citizens from murdering each other. It's a global hypocrisy. For the record, I believe the guy who killed the cop got a life sentence, which I should add is practically far more harsh than the death penalty itself. People who advocate for the death penalty are simply driven by their anger and emotions rather than their logic and sense of order. California should abolish the death penalty. We should decriminalize Marijuana and other drugs. We should stop wasting money and resources on locking people up and instead invest it in treatment programs, job programs, education programs for the people of our state. Just like disease it's much cheaper and more effective to prevent crime than it is to attempt to fight it once it has metastasized.","The problem with Ayn Rand's Objectivism is the focus on rational self-interest without making a very clear distinction from irrational self-interest.\n\nRational self interest might mean making decisions which are uncomfortable for yourself or others in the short term, but which can reasonably be expected to yield a benefit in the long term (i.e. saving a little money every week instead of wasting it on things you don't need, etc, which maybe you can use for education, starting a business or a charity, etc).\n\nIrrational self-interest is the greed-fueled, short-sighted selfishness, which has long term negative consequences that may potentially be far-reaching (i.e. let's cut all funds to education and health care so we can lower our taxes and make a profit while we are alive, and to hell with the next 3-5 generations who will live in illness, poverty and ignorance, and the ensuing wars that will follow in the global power vacuum).\n\nYou know, the liberal media's attack on her shows just how racist people are.  There's a free pass given to all the black so-called artists who create such hateful, ignorant music.  Why are they forgiven?  Because they are a product of their environment?  When you grow up poor and surrounded by evil people committing violence upon you, your friends, your family, when it's the police and the government too, that changes a person and gives rise to a lot of anger and resentments.  It is understandable.\n\nRand had grown up a child and saw some violence at the hands of hardline communists, who stole her father's small business, stole their house, rounded people up like animals, and wantonly murdered them.  We can't forgive her, because she is white?  That is a double standard, deplorable, ignorant, a very American attitude.  We don't even bother to try and understand what life experiences wounded her in such a way that she felt the need to protect herself.\n\nWhereas the these black musical artists sing about death and violence and material possessions and objectification and possession of women as trophy objects, and violent displays of pseudo-power, all these banal and immature topics, over and over again, not one of them nor all combined have created any cohesive work anywhere near the same scale as Rand.\n\nWhile I do not necessarily agree with many aspects of Rand's beliefs, and find many other aspects disagreeable or inexcusable, I do admire the way that she turned the pains and traumas or her childhood life into a belief system, into novels and movies, and she was able to make a modest living from the proceeds, and contributed something which has given us all something to consider and discuss, and in that regard, the mere existence of her life's work has enriched us all and elevated the discussion of belief systems and how they relate to the societies we form.\n\nI admire that she did this all without compromising the integrity of her self and what she believed in.  Merely that I strongly disagree with some of her assumptions, propositions statements or conjectures, does not fill me with any particular need to attack or disrespect her or call names.  This is one of the major warning flags of a society that is about to collapse: when the citizens lose the capacity to disagree peacefully and respectfully, in a mature and rational manner.","Climate Huckster Bill Nye The Fake ‚ÄòScience‚Äô Guy Goes Full-On Fascist in Latest Hateful Rant\nBill Nye ‚ÄòThe Science Guy‚Äô Says ‚ÄòClimate Deniers‚Äô Suffer Psychological Delusions\n \n  Chris White \n  \n Posted with permission from Daily Caller News Foundation \n  \n  \n   \n    Republish\nReprint \n   \n   \n  Bill Nye said Monday that climate change skeptics suffer from a \npsychological problem preventing them from understanding how so-called \nman-made global warming affects their daily lives. \n  Climate change skeptics suffer from cognitive dissonance on global \nwarming, a type of psychological disorder that prevents people from \nrecognizing reality, the comedian and former TV show host¬†told Sen.

It's \nup to environmentalists and everybody else to save skeptics from \nthemselves, he added. \n  \"Instead of accepting that the climate is changing, deniers are \ndenying the evidence and dismissing the authorities\" simply because they\n don't want to face a harsh reality, the comedian said. \n  The two climate change warriors went on to complain how fossil fuel\n companies' unwillingness to change their ways could lead to \ncatastrophe. \n  \"I know it may not be very popular thing to say, but the long-term \nimplications of doing nothing about climate change are catastrophic,\" \nNye said about what could happen if Americans don't take seriously \nPresident Donald Trump's skepticism. \n  Nye, who has a history of making dubious comments directed at \nskeptics, also brought up what he calls the connection between so-called\n denialism and the cigarette industry's refusal to acknowledge the \nnegative health properties of cigarettes. \n   \n  \"It's amazing to me that fossil fuel companies continue to use the same tactics as the tobacco industry,\" Nye told Sanders. \n  The comedian has made similar comments in the past. \n  \"Was it appropriate to jail the guys from Enron?\"¬†Nye¬†asked\n in a video interview with Climate Depot's Marc Morano in April 2016. \"We'll \nsee what happens.

I thought I was talking to a completely different College (Asheville University) when a recruiter contacted me. The recruiter failed to correct me. She lead me on until I finally figured out it was a for-profit, online school. The recruiter called me like a debt collector. She was getting frustrated because I'd talk to her but I didn't want to sign up without more research &amp; thought. She wound up literally yelling at me, \"JUST GO AHEAD &amp; SIGN UP!\" She kept telling me that my school would be 100% FREE &amp; that I needed to sign up before it was too late...too late for what? I couldn't understand to urgency to sign up. The recruiter was signing me up with every bit of information she could obtain from me. She told me the questions she asked where so I could receive more info (at my request) about Graduate Degrees they offered. I already have my BFA from a reputable , 4 year, brick and mortar college so I was very weary of online schools. The recruiter told me a crazy sob story about that she was a shoeshine girl at the airport before Ashford University gave her the education she needed to get out of the rut of poverty. I believed her lie at the time &amp; I felt bad for her. lol. Not for me, though. I guess she was trying to find a \"pain point\" with me cause I'd told her I was unemployed at the moment &amp; money was tight.

I was pissed beyond pissed. That recruiter bitch had signed me up for classes without my knowledge! I contacted the schools so-called president &amp; complained. I also called the BBB &amp; the California PD &amp; filed a complaint. I got an email stating that since I'd never signed into my 'student portal' I'd not be responsible for payments because I'd never attended Ashford University. I could have shit. It took me days &amp; nights to get that response from the President of Ashford. So glad I never even attempted to sign-in to anything or they might have claimed I was an attending student. Years later, I got a phone call from that same recruiter asking me why I never continued with my application for Ashford University. All I responded was, \"you do this type of thing to so many people, that you REALLY don't remember me, do you?\" She hung up on me &amp; I haven't gotten another call since then. Ashford could have ruined me with debt. I was one of the lucky ones cause I knew how to fight back. I feel terrible for those who got sucked into their scam.","I can't speak for the US health care system as I am not an American, but everywhere around the world mental health and how to treat it is a major issue, and it isn't helped by the massive stigma surrounding it. It is true that those with mental illnesses are far more likely to be victims than perpetrators, (and that's not including those who develop mental illnesses as a result of being victimised in certain situations) but as soon as something happens mental illness is the first explanation and seems to be an easy blame. Speaking as someone who suffers from depression, general anxiety disorder, OCD and panic disorder the number of times that I have been told to \"get over it\", that I'm \"overreacting\", or to \"just think happy\" makes me so incredibly frustrated. Mental illness is not something that is made up or attention seeking, it is a physiological problem of chemical imbalances in the brain. My opinion is that it is still an issue that is very much misunderstood and as a result people rely on what they know which is frequently coming from the stigma. \nAnd as for the issue of gun control and massacres being blamed on the mentally ill, guns and other weapons, no matter in whose hands they are in can be dangerous. It doesn't take much for an accident to happen and a situation result in disaster - for example, toddlers touching loaded guns and ending up killing or seriously injuring their family members without meaning to. And maybe those who carry out intentional and pre-mediated attacks may have a mental illness. But they are only a very small fraction of those of us who have diagnosed conditions - many of whom, like myself worry that we are a burden on the world though in the eyes of the law and often in others perspective, we have done nothing that we should feel so exceedingly guilty about.","First off, I want to say that I love this show and the progressive nature with which it confronts current issues. I love how racism, sexism, and many other important issues are tackles in a¬† thought-provoking manner.\nThis segment, however, was terribly disappointing. While I understand that sarcasm may have been intended in pointing out that turkeys are ‚Äòguilty of having delicious meat‚Äô, that sarcasm was obviously ignored, or not even perceived, by the jock-like whooping that occurred right after John Oliver made the comment.\nThe sad fact is that these social, feeling animals suffer horrendously for the sake of their 'delicious meat'. Very few people deny that animals feel pain, but this fact is conveniently ignored when the issue of ‚Äòfood‚Äô is concerned. In fact, it‚Äôs ignored in order to justify the exploitation of animals in so many arenas. But if we stop dismissing the suffering that these sentient beings go through, we would see that their torture and death is not worth it.\n\nAnd while meat-eaters become increasingly defensive about the issue, it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that veganism is a growing social justice movement. Animal exploitation is an oppression like no other in history. Not only does it unjustly inflict horrible suffering on animals, it pollutes our airs and our waters, it poisons our bodies and it poisons our minds.\nAlbert Schweitzer aptly said ‚ÄúUntil we extend our circle of compassion to all living things, humanity will not find peace.‚Äù And there is so much truth to that.\nIf disingenuousness prevents the writers at Last Week Tonight from admitting that animal suffering is wrong, perhaps they can at least not bring up the subject altogether."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>short_title<\/th>\n      <th>vid_created<\/th>\n      <th>com_text<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":1,"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[1,10,25,50,100],"rowCallback":"function(row, data) {\nvar value=data[0]; if (value!==null) $(this.api().cell(row, 0).node()).css({'font-size':'15px'});\nvar value=data[1]; if (value!==null) $(this.api().cell(row, 1).node()).css({'font-size':'15px'});\nvar value=data[2]; if (value!==null) $(this.api().cell(row, 2).node()).css({'font-size':'15px'});\n}"},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row"}},"evals":["options.rowCallback"],"jsHooks":[]}</script><!--/html_preserve-->

If it takes you 10 minutes by car to get to work in the city, lets make some reasonable assumptions. Let's assume the traffic + stops slows your average speed to a (generous!) 45mph. 45mph/.166hr = 7.5 miles to work. I walk ~4mph. That means it would take me less time to walk to this lady's work that it takes her to ride the bus? How about biking? Wide open roads at a reasonable pace is 12mph = 38 minutes. Or maybe you take your time and mosey along at 7.5mph = 1hr. If the 10-minute travel time is based on an average vehicle speed of anything lower than 45mph, the distance she's going decreases even more.\nCome on people, it's hard to muster up the sympathy I'm supposed to feel for this lady when you could ditch the train fare, bus fare, and gym membership and get a nice, refreshing workout and get to work faster cheaper and happier!

While the exact details change periodically, it effectively takes into consideration your education, age, language skills, whether you have a sponsor or job lined up, and other factors that (essentially) allow us to select the top 10% most likely to succeed from countries like India. \n\nBasically, when you select an individual with a Masters' degree in Software engineering from IIT, who speaks flawless English, and has a job lined up as a software developer for an accounting firm they will probably be a net benefit to a country. In contrast, if you follow the American illegal-immigrant model, you get a lot of low skilled workers with limited education and poor language skills who compete against the needy in your own country for jobs and limited aid from the government.","well that's nice of you France that really is nice smart eh who needs intelligence when you can just be nice all the time right liberals\n\nnice&gt;smart \nevery time","The Theory of Life\n\nThe Theory of Life states that to find the meaning of Life/God, one must first understand The Law of Nature\n\nThe Law of Nature states that Enlightenment is the cause of behaviors.\n\tWhat is behavior?\n\tthe way in which one acts or conducts oneself, especially toward others.\n\n\tWhat is Enlightenment?\n\tEnlightenment is a Sense of Self that is reached by the research and analysis of both Knowledge and Understanding.\n\n\t\tWhat is Sense of Self?\n\t\tThe value of which relates to how one perceives Truth or Deception.\n\n\t\tWhat are the Forces of Nature?\n\t\tEnergy and Strength attributed to emotion caused by the degree of which one is Enlightened.\n\n\t\tWhat is Knowledge?\n\t\tWhat we know.

People, including the  makers of this video, think that by attacking her person they belittle her and prove her wrong, which is not the case. Her philosophy makes man ambitious, respectful of others and a thinking human being. She never said one should never help others, she only advocated rational self interest. She was pro choice and asked us to not think on the range of the moment but pursue a life dedicated to goals detached from results and attached to performing the duty. Of course she was fallible in having that scene in the novel where Roark forces himself on Dominique or saying that a woman should not be president of the US or her comments on natives. We all have flaws, however for the most part Rand's philosophy of objectivism is a testament to the glorious heights that are possible to human beings. Just read her arguments on the value of money, the morality of sex, values required to love and be loved, importance of productive work to life, the need to speak the truth always and one will have a more reasoned existence on the planet. She forces people to look inward and that is what most people avoid doing all of their life, and this has caused her to become universally hated. Look at the number of people liking this video making an ad hominen argument which does nothing to decry her philosophy. It will be interesting to know how many likers of these videos have actually read her books like We the living, Anthem, Night of January 16th and The Romanticism Manifesto.  After Millenia of its existence mankind produced one philosopher whose philosophy allows people to live together peacefully and happily,not as a tribe but as individual men of achievement and look how much she is detested. Tells us a lot about people.","Pepe is so soft spoken, but that just makes you lean in and listen even more closely to his very eloquent words.

If party A gets 25% in the whole country it will get 25% of the seats of the Bundestag.\nBut of course it's also important that every district is represented by at least one politician. That still works. Every district can still be won by a politician and this politician has a guarantee for a seat. But in the end that could mean that a party won in so many districts, that it has the guarantee for more seats than it would have by overall votes in the whole country. That leads to a bias again and it was a problem until 2013. Since then we have something called \"compensation mandates\". If a party won more seats by wining single districts than they should get, then the other partys get more seats until the distribution is correct again.\n\nAnd as long as the distribution of your seats is only determined by who won which district, there will never be a thrid party in Whashington.

And please don't patronise us when saying how could you vote for brexit we new what we were voting for and I like most who voted leave we are\nPro immigration \nInternationalists\nWe want a fair immigration system for all and they say the young voted to remain but me and my friends voted for brexit and it was the  first time I had ever voted and I knew I was going to change the country for the better so that we can make our own free trade deals around the world, set a fair immigration system,\nTo take control of our laws and our money \n\nI wonder if America would be happy to be part of a political project to join with the Eu and to let them have control of your borders and your trade and fishing water rights I think they would say no.\n\nAnd this presenter has no idea of the impact on the continent of Europe the Eu has had mass unemployment, mass immigration, far right getting more support than ever before all brought on by the Eu puting austerity on an unprecedented level .","If you are a non Indian trying to figure out what is happening in India, consider this video to be quite accurate .( Indian guy from the web approves this video)\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Since I am a Modi-supporter ( like the majority of Indians who supported the Modi campaign , leading to Modi's ¬†clean sweep victory ¬†in the elections) I would like to highlight some of the points.\n1) The BJP and RSS were rightly called Hindu extremists (they were not even much popular among the sensible Indian Youth before) , but things have changed drastically .¬†\n¬† ¬†Modi ( preferably Modi-the hardworking) made his place up to the top in the BJP .\nHis commendable work in Gujrat surely helped him the most. Since the time he had become the top contender for PM , he had a great role in changing how the campaigning is done, what topics the party should stress on etc.\nI haven't heard of even ¬†a single extremist Hindu remark from those people from a long time :).\n2) Previously, Politics in India was about ' putting in the minds of people the notion that they different from each other' and exploiting the cultural and religious differences. ( For the sake of staying in the competition , Parties be like \" Support us we are pro- Hindu/Muslim/Dalit etc\" and hence securing each section of the 'vote bank' ) ¬†So the Hindus will have BJP as their favourite , The Muslim - Congress....etc\n¬†What they had instilled in mind of the people ¬†is that they can develop only if the 'section' they belong to develops.\n3) The Modi Campaign talked about development of India as a whole, and not certain sections. He broke the trend of negative politics and only focused on all the positive he could promise . Modi's speeches after winning the elections stressed on the one phrase \"Sab ka Saath , Sab ka Vikaas\" ( what he wanted to say is that ' even if u voted for me or not , I will make sure everybody develops , but for that I will need everybody's support from now on ')\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† I just want all non-Indians to stop worrying that Modi will be the next Hitler ( please note that a huge number of Muslims voted for Modi and they were neither stupid nor under some delusion ). He is a very positive guy .","(See John Olivers Televangelist show). Trump is as earnest and effective as the tax exempt televangelist are.

The democratic kind imposes *neutrality of signal carriage* on all service providers, which is a decidedly non-neutral stance towards them. The plutocratic kind imposes *neutrality of interference* on the regulatory body, so it has to stay neutral when it comes to what ISPs are doing with their service, which is a decidedly non-neutral stance towards the general public. What we are in favour of is democratic net neutrality (the kind that's in the interest of a healthy democracy), what ISPs are in favour is plutocratic net neutrality (the kind where money determines what's shop, which serves its own interests).\n\nThe pipes and wires connecting and supporting our civilization are de facto a public utility. The internet is having a hard time being properly codified as such in the US, which comes at no surprise when considering how influential the oligopoly feeding on the cable and internet infrastructure is. There are those making the argument that the free market should decide, and whilst people like me tend not to be in favour of the free market regulating access to information and discourse, there is something else that many are not considering: That in the US, there is no free market in that regard as it stands. For there to even be fertile ground for a free market solution for ISP services, there has to be legislation that opens up the infrastructure as a neutral body for businesses to take part in and provide services without corporate encumberment.","To clarify, sexual orientation is NOT who you love. That is Romantic Orientation. For example, you could be homosexual but biromantic, meaning you love both binary genders but are only sexually attracted to the opposite sex. You could be asexual but homoromantic. Sometimes, but not always, the sexual orientation and romantic orientation will line up. \n\nAgain, sexual orientation is who you'd screw, not who you love. Romantic orientation is who you love, not who you'd screw. \n\nYou can love someone but not want to screw them, or you could want to screw someone rather than love them. You DO NOT have to be attracted to every single person that lines up with your sexual preference, nor do you have to love everyone that coincides with your romantic preferences.","normally I don't comment on videos out of principle. But I gotta say this video really annoyed me just for the fact that it keeps propagating the age-old belief that steroids will somehow make you a better athlete which is not always the case. First off it makes the assumption that everyone is born with an equal advantage in whatever sport they choose which is definitely not the case. some people are naturally gifted and some things come harder to others and that's just a fact that regularly we all agree does exist. yet for some apparent reason we think that there's a magical drug out there called steroids that you would inject and all of a sudden you become amazing remember Barry Bonds was ripping it before he did the steroids remember a lot of these athletes are already great athletes and they merely do steroids as a way to how would you say crossed the t's and Dot the I's. If you're going to say that steroids make a better athlete watch the movie bigger better faster stronger and you will see a guy, who is on roids huge arms whole nine, in a batting cage and he can't hit one ball not one and he keeps swinging and Swinging with those Titanic arms and it doesn't mean anything why because it takes Talent not just steroids. and for all these clean athletes out there you just gotta remember drug tested is not mean drug-free it just means that the time of the test that nothing in their system that does not mean at any point in time they are not using some sort of enhancement to better Aid recovery strength-building numerous benefits...","First of all, this is a great and very interesting show.

One of the top ten best cities to live in the US according to Business Insider, as well as top places to live if you're vegan or maybe smoke marijuana. We're bursting with libraries and museums, from the Experience Music Project And Pacific Science Center to the Museum of Flight and Burke Natural History Museum. We have a big theater culture, as well as art film theaters, and you can catch something to broaden your horizons any day. Live music and art collectives sprawl through tiny coffee shops in every neighborhood. The zip code I live in, in south Seattle, is the most diverse in the entire country. There are so many beautiful places to walk in Seattle, stunning views of Mt. Rainier, whales right in our backyard, and 94% of Seattle residents have a park within walking distance of where they live. We do get quite a bit of rain, but we also have one of the most temperate climates in the US, so summer isn't too hot and it hardly snows in winter.

I say this with the utmost respect for your beautiful wife, I am sure you chose the right girl for you,  and, because you are married, I have no aspirations of a romantic experience with you.I admire you as an idol, and I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you. Thank you John for being who you are. The smartest, funniest, most insightful and proper person that I ever experienced, but also because you worked hard to become  such a star. To spread your brilliant ideas across and through your talent make the world a better place. I feel hopeful of a better world because of the multitude of people  who appreciate your show. I feel proud that a white supremacist shithead mentions you in his hate speech, as an opponent force. Did  you ever think you would be such a powerful force?\nI never had an idol before. I mean, I loved Whitney Houston when I was 16 and tried to sing like her but that did not work well at all. But the moment I watched your first show I could not help but watch every single one of them over the a few months.  Then I researched about you, and you know, I am 32 years old and I  feel the impulse to collect pictures of you. Maybe not. But I am just so happy that a guy with your wonderful ideas, wonderful vision of the world, is empowered to broadcast yourself and inspire others to do the right things, to make sense of this crazy world, and do this with a sharp  sense of humor.\nYou are wonderful John Oliver, wonderful. I feel ridiculous to say this because I am not 15 years old and as a grown woman have a demanding job and many responsibilities, but deep inside I cultivate the dream of, someday, meet you in person and say to you, how inspired I am by you.\nAs I am sure it will never happen, though I will keep the more realistic expectation that this letter reaches you.

The _most positive_ videos are not actually main stories, but small stories or web specials. But the _most negative_ ones are main stories about very hard topics like mental health, opioids and abortion, that makes people outraged. This totally makes sense: John always mixes hard stories with some comic relief in between. As he never covers a happy ending main story, the _happy_ videos are some comic short ones or web exclusives.

# Youtube vs Facebook

My husband and I were discussing which audience would be more positive: the Youtube one or the Facebook one. We came up with the theory that Youtube seems more aggressive for some reason, but it was just our intuition. Now that I have the chance, I'm going to find out!

## Fetching Facebook videos and comments

First I have to retrieve [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LastWeekTonight/) videos. I find the `Rfacebook` package way easier than `tuber` to interact with the [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api), since you don't have to deal with pages to get the videos nor the comments. 

You have to create a temporary access token (you can also try with a more permanent one, all you need to know is in [this package documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rfacebook/Rfacebook.pdf)) and you are ready! With `getPage` and `n = 5000` you retrieve 5000 posts. It is an exaggerated number, but I want to make sure I get all of them (there are 559 at the moment, in case you are wondering).

As I want only the videos coming from Youtube (so I can compare the comments), I filter the posts using a regular expression and then join the table with the `videos` dataframe from the Youtube videos to have the video information.


```r
library(Rfacebook)

fb_token <- ####

fb_page <- getPage("LastWeekTonight", fb_token, n = 5000)

videos_fb <- fb_page %>% 
  filter(type == "video" &
           link == str_match(link, "^https://www.youtube.com/watch\\?v=.+")) %>% 
  mutate(ids = str_match(link, "^https://www.youtube.com/watch\\?v=([^&]+)")[,2]) %>% 
  left_join(videos, by = c("ids" = "id")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(short_title))
```

Then I retrieve the comments.


```r
library(purrr)
fb_com <- lapply(videos_fb$id, getPost, token = fb_token, n = 300)

fb_comments <- {}
for (i in 1:length(fb_com)) {
  post_id_fb   <- fb_com[[i]]$post$id
  com_id       <- fb_com[[i]]$comments$id
  com_text     <- fb_com[[i]]$comments$message
  com_created  <- fb_com[[i]]$comments$created_time
  fb_comments  <- fb_comments %>% 
    bind_rows(data.frame(post_id_fb, com_id, com_text, com_created))
}
```

To prepare the data for the comparison I used a lot of code, and very similar than the one used for Youtube! I don't want to get either repetitive or boring, so I'm not showing it here but you can [see everything here]({{< ref "post/2017-05-29-code-to-compare-facebook-and-youtube-s-comments" >}}).

I kept only 300 comments for every video on every platform.

## Youtube vs Facebook - Positive and Negative words 

One thing I'm curious about is the difference in words used in both platforms. On (_my_) Facebook, people don't swear that much, probably because they are fiends with their grandmother... But let's put this theory to test, let's plot them together!








```r
library(gridExtra)

grid.arrange(arrangeGrob(yt_pos_neg_words, top = "Youtube"), 
             arrangeGrob(fb_pos_neg_words, top = "Facebook"), nrow = 2)
```

<img src="/post/how-do-you-feel-about-last-week-tonight/2017-05-29-how-do-you-feel-about-last-week-tonight/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png" style="margin: auto;" />

Some remarks here:

* People don't talk as much on Facebook! Youtube's words exceed 2,000 and Facebook's ones only go up to 500. I thought people on Facebook would be more verbal than on Youtube, but I only use this platform to see some specific videos and I've never left (or even read!) a comment there, so I'm far from an expert on this field.

* People don't use _the F-word_ that much on Facebook! I attribute it the _the granny effect_ üëµ

## Youtube vs Facebook - Sentiment on videos
  
To compare comments I filter only the videos in both platforms (this is part of [what is shown here]({{< ref "post/2017-05-29-code-to-compare-facebook-and-youtube-s-comments" >}})) and plot the sentiment chronologically (try to hover over the lines to see the date and name of the video). Here I use the mean of sentiment for every chapter.





```r
library(plotly)
ggplotly(comments_by_title %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(short_title, vid_created), 
             text = paste(short_title, "<br />",  vid_created))) +
  geom_line(aes(y = mean_sent_fb, group = 1), color = "blue") +
  geom_line(aes(y = mean_sent_yt, group = 1), color = "red") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab(NULL) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()),
tooltip = "text")

# Wordcloud!

You were probably hoping for this! I couldn't pass up the opportunity to make a wordcloud üéâ Are those awesome or what?!


```r
library(wordcloud)
library(viridis)
library(tm)

words <- toString(yt_comments$com_text) %>%
  str_split(pattern = " ", simplify = TRUE)

wordcloud(words, colors = viridis::viridis_pal(end = 0.8)(10),
          min.freq = 800, random.color = TRUE, max.words = 100,
          scale = c(3.5,.03))
```

# The end

Well, I hope you enjoyed this article as much as I did while writing it! It was so amusing to play with all these tools, and find out the feelings behind all those people who, like me, enjoy this show. If you haven't watch any episode yet, I recommend you give it a try. As we can see here: you won't probably be indifferent about it!

Despite this post being fairly extensive, it was actually hard for me to pick what to show here. You can [find the complete analysis here](https://github.com/d4tagirl/John-Oliver-sentiment-analysis), and feel free to reach out to me with your comments üòÉ
