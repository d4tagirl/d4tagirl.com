Hi! üëãüèΩ

My name is Daniela and I'm a Data Scientist. I am from [Uruguay, a little country in South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay) where I also live.

I _used to be_ an Economist, but I only worked in that field briefly in the Academia. After completing my studies, I joined Equifax, where I discovered and fell in love with Data Science. Following that, I transitioned to a startup specializing in Natural Language Processing and Social Media data. Subsequently, I played a key role in implementing the Uruguayan social security models using R and Shiny and I collaborated closely with the technical team responsible for designing the Uruguayan Social Security System recent reform. Over the past 11 years, I've been deeply involved in the field of Data Science.

Finding out about R-Ladies was a game changer for me: it made me realize that *I* needed to change to live in a more inclusive world, and that has been my goal ever since. I first joined the [R-Ladies Global community](https://rladies.org/) as one of the [Buenos Aires chapter](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-buenos-aires/)'s founders, and then I co-founded the [Montevideo chapter](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-montevideo/). We had such a great time building this community in Montevideo, that the next thing was to start the R User Group, [GURU::MVD](https://www.meetup.com/GURU-mvd/). I recently joined the [Global team](https://rladies.org/about-us/global-team/) as the head of Social Media. I'm also involved in the organization of [LatinR](https://latin-r.com/en): we are building a beautiful Latin American community that I'm happy to be part of <3. 

A few years ago I got accepted to join the [NASA Datanauts program](https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/), another very inclusive community where in a collaborative environment you use NASA's data and tools and improve your data science skills. I found out about this program through some R-Ladies :)

This is my blog where I share whatever it is that I'm playing with at the moment. I recently became a mom, so it's been a while since I published my last article, but I'm hoping that can change soon!

I hope you enjoy my posts as much as I enjoy writing them, and please feel welcome to leave your comments and [mention me on Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@d4tagirl) :)
