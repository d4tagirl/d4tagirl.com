Hi! üëãüèΩ

I'm Daniela, a Data Scientist from [Uruguay](https://www.guruguay.com/) ‚Äì a charming little country in South America, which I also call home.

Originally an Economist with a brief stint in academia, my journey took a pivotal turn at Equifax, where I discovered my passion for Data Science. This led to a venture into a startup focused on Natural Language Processing and Social Media data, eventually bringing me to a significant role in revamping the Uruguayan Social Security System using R and Shiny. Over the last 11 years, I've immersed myself deeply in Data Science.

Discovering [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) was a watershed moment for me. It spurred a personal commitment to foster a more inclusive world ‚Äì a mission I've been dedicated to ever since. Starting as a co-founder of the R-Ladies Buenos Aires chapter, I then co-founded the Montevideo chapter. The joy of building this community led to the birth of GURU::MVD, the R User Group in Montevideo. More recently, I've joined the Global team as the head of Social Media and am  involved in organizing [LatinR](https://latin-r.com/en), nurturing a vibrant Latin American community.

Welcome to my blog! This is my little corner for diving into data science, where I share my discoveries and experiences. Admittedly, since becoming a mom, my blog posts have become a bit like a rare comet sighting ‚Äì not as frequent as they used to be! But I'm excited to pick up where I left off and start sharing more with you all again soon.

I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them. Feel free to leave comments and [connect with me on Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@d4tagirl). üôÇ
