My name is Daniela and I'm a Data Scientist. I am from [Uruguay, a little country in South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay) where I also live.

Originally I studied Economics, but only worked in that field briefly in the Academia. Right when I finished my studies I started working at Equifax where I discovered (*and fell in love with!*) Data Science. After that I worked at [Idatha](http://www.idatha.com/), a company that specializes in Natural Language Processing and Social Media data, and now I work on my own. I've been working in Data Science for the last 8 years. 

R-Ladies was a game changer for me: it made me realize that *I* needed to change to live in a more inclusive world, and that is my goal ever since. I first joined the [R-Ladies Global community](https://rladies.org/) as one of the [Buenos Aires chapter](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-buenos-aires/) founders, and then I co-founded the [Montevideo chapter](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-montevideo/). We had such a success building the R-Ladies community in Montevideo, that the next thing was to start the Montevideo R User Group, [GURU::MVD](https://www.meetup.com/GURU-mvd/). I'm also involved in the organization of [LatinR](https://latin-r.com/en): we are building a beautiful Latin American community that I'm happy to be part of <3. 

I'm also a [NASA Datanaut](https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/), another very inclusive community where in a collaborative environment you use NASA's data and tools and improve your data science skills.

This is my blog where I share whatever it is that I'm playing with at the moment. I recently became a mom, so it's been a while since I published my last article, but I'm hoping that can change soon!

I hope you enjoy my posts as much as I enjoy writing them, and please feel welcome to leave your comments and [mention me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?user_id=114258616) :)
