[Applications for the rstudio::conf(2019) are now open](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/08/10/rstudio-conf-2019-diversity-scholarships/)! Last year I was lucky enough to be the receipient of an international diversity scholarships to attend 
rstudio::conf(2018). It was hard to believe at first, but it was true! 

I live in Uruguay, South America, so it's extra expensive for me to attend R conferences that are mainly hosted far away from here. There is now a clear community effort in building a stronger latin american R community, take a look at [LatinR 2018 in Argentina](http://latin-r.com/) and [ConectaR 2019 in Costa Rica](https://www.conectar2019.org/)! But this was hardly the case in previous years.

# The application

By the time to apply for the scholarship, I was going through an _"I won't lose anything if I try"_ phase that led me to apply to all of the R conferences that I could, even when I wasn't having any positive responses. It was pretty obvious to me that they could use the money to finance 3 or 4 people from around, instead of only me having greater impact! And I was at peace with that. But I wanted to know what it felt like to _live_ the R community in person, a community I was being a part of for more than a year by then. So I tried one more time.

I know it is hard to express all your excitement and how you expect to impact your community with what you'll learn in a couple of sentences... Just in case you are looking for inspiration, you can check my application out!

I want to gather the experience of other communities so I can be a better host and make the most of R-Ladies Montevideo and Buenos Aires‚Äô communities._

If you are still not sure, you can [request an application review to the _R-Ladies Abstract/Scholarship Review Program_](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSck8FBjNWjziI8pPIoCBlf5J4oQ_6pzeUdbQ1HjYfJ2bNDwDw/viewform), lead by the amazing [Jennifer Thompson](https://twitter.com/jent103) for all the R-Ladies out there!

# About the scholarship

The scholarship covered the admission to both the conference and a training session (workshop) of my choice, as well as $3,000 towards our other related expenses like flight and hotel. Since breakfast, lunch and breaks were provided daily, it basically covered all my expenses. I found a good deal on my flight and the rest was enough for me to book a room at the conference hotel (that came with a regular visitor as you can see in the pic), so I didn't have to pay for anything!

<div align="center"><img src="/figure/source/rstudio-conf-diversity-scholarships-for-the-win/2018-08-16-rstudio-conf-diversity-scholarships-for-the-win/room_with_a_view.JPG" width="200" /></div>

RStudio offered to put us in touch with other like-minded scholarship recipient so we could share a room. That's a great opportunity to meet new people!

Anne Carome was my point of contact and she was great! Very supportive and taking care of every detail!

# About the conference

RStudio::conf(2018) took place in San Diego, California, January 31-Feb 3. 

The conference for me started two days earlier, with the 2 days workshop (to choose from a total of 11 ones aimed to both beginners and experts) to go deeper into a topic. It is a great opportunity to learn some techniques from really amazing Teachers and TAs (some times you even learn how to use a package from its creators or contributors, which is pretty awesome!). 

Keynote speakers were [_Dianne Cook_](https://twitter.com/visnut), with _‚ÄúTo the Tidyverse and Beyond: Challenges for the Future in Data Science‚Äù_ and [_JJ Allaire_](https://twitter.com/fly_upside_down) with _‚ÄúMachine Learning with R and TensorFlow‚Äù_. There were 2 fireside chats: a _"Tidyverse discussion"_ with [_Jenny Bryan_](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/), [_Mine √áetinkaya-Rundel_](https://twitter.com/minebocek), [_Max Kuhn_](https://twitter.com/topepos) and [_Hadley Wickham_](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham), were [_Mara Averick_](https://twitter.com/dataandme) was the moderator. And a _"R in industry discussion"_ with [_Eduardo Ari√±o de la Rubia_](https://twitter.com/earino), [_Tanya Cashorali_](https://twitter.com/tanyacash21), [_Eric Colson_](https://twitter.com/ericcolson), [_Elaine McVey_](https://twitter.com/eamcvey?lang=es), [_David Robinson_](https://twitter.com/drob), where [_Tareef Kawaf_](https://twitter.com/tareefk) was the moderator. There were also over 60 great 15 minutes talks, divided into 3 simultaneous tracks. You can [check the full conference schedule here](https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3105/) and [all the videos here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/rstudioconf-2018-talks/).

We could enjoy an _R-Ladies' Birds of a Feather_ session, where we had the opportunity to meet and greet with all the R-Ladies, and spread the love üíú It was the perfect ocassion to take a pic!

There were 2 parties involved (more on that next!). The first one was at the hotel pool, where there was some balloons and a book signing involved.

The other was a rooftop party at the Hard Rock Hotel ü§ò

# About the R community

Undoubtedly one of the things I enjoyed the most about the conference was meeting people. I'm somewhat active in the R community on Twitter and on the R-Ladies Slack, but I've never had the opportunity to meet the community in person (with a few exceptions). I can endorse now what is widely spread about the R community being extremely friendly and welcoming to new folks. I felt at home immediately and _Twitter friends_ were coming to say hi as soon as they saw me :)

My first contact with the community was with [Gaby](https://twitter.com/gdequeiroz?lang=es), the founder of R-Ladies. I have had met her before, and everytime we meet is like we could spend hours talking :)

<div align="center"><img src="/figure/source/rstudio-conf-diversity-scholarships-for-the-win/2018-08-16-rstudio-conf-diversity-scholarships-for-the-win/gaby.JPG" width="200" /></div>

Then [Page Piccinini](https://twitter.com/pageinini) kindly organized an R-Ladies San Diego Meetup, where Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan gave talks and we had some time to meet and chat with many R-Ladies and allies.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks so much to everyone who came out tonight! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RLadies?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RLadies</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/classy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@classy</a> <a href="https://t.co/3Nje42i8vf">pic.twitter.com/3Nje42i8vf</a></p>&mdash; R-Ladies San Diego (@RLadiesSanDiego) <a href="https://twitter.com/RLadiesSanDiego/status/958562941346889728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<br />

There was plenty of time to chat and get involved with the community throughout the conference, during breakfast, lunch and breaks, but also between sessions and at the many social events like the bof sessions and parties. RStudio made sure of that, as well as the very friendly and welcoming R community.

Here are some pics from the event; you can find [some beautiful ones here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5Ylt7n46V3RYyoTH2) that [JD Long](https://twitter.com/cmastication) took and shared.

We ended up having a short roadtrip with [Flor](https://twitter.com/cantoflor_87), another international scholarship recipient from Buenos Aires, Argentina, that was the beggining of a beautiful frienship :)

# The end

It was time to go home, but after that I felt a completely different connection with the community. And we now have this tweet :)

Needless to say: I encourage anyone interested in R to attend this conference. I'm sure I'll go again as soon as I can!
