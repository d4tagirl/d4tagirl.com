I analize the \#rstats on Twitter to check if "The Ratio" actually makes sense for this community. What is "The Ratio" you ask? There is this theory that if a tweet has more replies than likes and retweets, that implies that people are not happy about it. 

<!--more-->



Not long ago I came across [a FiveThirtyEight post called "The Worst Tweeter In Politics Isn‚Äôt Trump"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-worst-tweeter-in-politics-isnt-trump/). Well, it was a long time ago actually, but this project was laying in my computer for a while ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. They gathered some resources from the media discussing that tweets leading to more replies than likes and retweets are the ones that make the community angry. This phenomenon is known as "The Ratio" as Luke O‚ÄôNeil wrote recently [in Esquire](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a54440/twitter-ratio-reply/).

FiveThirtyEight used a ternary plot to illustrate the proportion of replies, retweets and likes of every Trump tweet. In this post I'm going to plot tweets with the rstats hashtag, suspecting that the ones that have a higher ratio of replies might be an exception to this rule since conversations tend to be pretty friendly in this community. But let's find out!

# Disclaimer

It wasn‚Äôt until I had this post ready for publishing that I realized the replies the media were discussing were the direct ones, without considering the replies of the replies, so **I just invented a new ratio** üò± I spent a great amount of extra work to consider all the replies (direct and indirect ones) but I liked the way it turned out and the way I had to solve some problems, so I‚Äôll just stick with _my personal definition of the ratio_, knowing it‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs supposed to be üíÅ

# Retrieving the data

I'm becoming more and more fan of the `rtweet` package, built and maintained by [Michael W. Kearney](https://twitter.com/kearneymw?lang=en). It's _the_ way to go when you want to interact with Twitter's API using R. I fetch some tweets with `#rstats` to analize!


```r
library(rtweet)
library(dplyr)
tweets_rstats <- search_tweets(q = "#rstats",
                                include_rts = FALSE,
                                n = 300)

tweets_rstats <- tweets_rstats %>%
  distinct()
```

I already have the number of retweets and the number of likes of each original tweet, but not the number of replies. To build the ternary plot (or pyramid as I prefer to call it) I need the number of replies as well. As the API doesn't have a direct method to do this, so I have to do it by hand.




Here comes the `purrr` part. The `purrr` package is receiving a lot of love this year: there is a group sharing [the _#purrrResolution_](https://twitter.com/hashtag/purrrresolution?src=hash&lang=en), courtesy of [Isabella Ghement](https://twitter.com/IsabellaGhement/status/949349863853977600) that you can join:

And [Colin Fay](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay) created [the Twitter collection _\#RStats ‚Äî Your daily dose of \#purrr_](https://twitter.com/i/moments/950031718521671680) with great tips!

I collect all the mentions to all `screen_names` in the `orig_tweets` dataframe. I use `distinct(screen_names)` because I don't want to call the API more than once for every `screen_name`.


```r
library(purrr)
library(tidyr)

orig_tweets_mentions <- orig_tweets %>%
  distinct(screen_name) %>%           
  mutate(query = paste0("@", screen_name, " OR ", "to:", screen_name, " OR ", screen_name)) %>%
  mutate(tweets = pmap(list(q = .$query,
                            n = 1000,
                            retryonratelimit = TRUE),
                       rtweet::search_tweets)) %>%
  select(tweets) %>%
  unnest()
```

Here I'm joining the conversation by using the `pmap` function to fetch all the mentions to all the `screen_name`s in the `orig_tweets` dataframe. The API only returns tweets from the last 6 to 10 days, but it should suffice. As [Lucy](https://twitter.com/lucystats?lang=en) pointed out in [her post about Twitter Trees](https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/07/24/twitter-trees/), querying the API using only `to: screen_name` misses some tweets, so I took her recommendation of including `@screen_name` and `OR screen_name`. You will notice that I took a lot of ideas from her blog post, which I highly recommend if you like to work with Twitter conversations.

I need to apply the `rtweet::search_tweets` function to each `screen_name` in the `orig_tweets` dataframe, passing more than one argument to the function: `pmap` is the answer! You can pass a list of arguments to the `pmap` function for it to pass them on to the `search_tweets` one. In this case I pass `q`: the query, `n`: the number of tweets I want, and `retryonratelimit`: set to TRUE for it to wait and retry when rate limited.

This is what I get:

# Getting the chain of replies

Then I'll use another resource from [Lucy's **genius** post to get the chain of replies from a tweet](https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/07/24/twitter-trees/). I create a function that takes the `status_id` as input, and returns all the replies and the replies of that replies and so on. Again I use `purrr` to apply the function to all the `status_id`s from the `orig_tweets` dataframe, but this time I need to pass only one argument to the function, so I use `map` instead of `pmap`.


```r
get_replies_chain <- function(id) {
  diff <- 1
  while (diff != 0) {
    id_next <- orig_tweets_mentions %>%
      filter(reply_to_status_id %in% id) %>%
      pull(status_id)
    id_new <- unique(c(id, id_next))
    diff <- length(id_new) - length(id)
    id <- id_new
  }
  orig_tweets_mentions %>% 
    filter(reply_to_status_id %in% id)
}

replies <- orig_tweets %>%
  mutate(replies = purrr::map(.$status_id,
                       get_replies_chain)) %>%
  tidyr::unnest(replies) %>%
  select(status_id, screen_name, text, status_id_reply = status_id1) %>%
  distinct()
```

The reason I needed the replies is to count them, because in the original tweet I only have the number of retweets and the number of likes, but not the number of replies. The last step is to count the replies!


```r
replies_count <- replies %>%
  group_by(status_id) %>%
  summarise(reply_count = n()) %>%
  ungroup
```

# Building the pyramid

I build a dataframe with the variables I need for the plot. I create the `ratio` variables that is **_The Ratio_**, the proportion of `replies` to `replies + faves` (or likes as we call them now), that is our variable of interest.


```r
tweets_tern <- orig_tweets %>%
  left_join(replies_count, by = "status_id") %>%
  mutate(reply_count = coalesce(reply_count, 0L),
         ratio = reply_count / (reply_count + favorite_count)) %>%
  select(screen_name, status_id, 
         replies = reply_count, 
         RTs = retweet_count, 
         faves = favorite_count,
         ratio)
```

I build a different dataframe containing the mean of `replies`, `RTs` and `faves`, for reference.

```r
tweets_tern_mean <- tweets_tern %>%
  summarize(mean_replies = mean(replies),
            mean_rt      = mean(RTs),
            mean_fave    = mean(faves))
```

For building the pyramid I use the [ggtern package](http://www.ggtern.com/), an extension to the `ggplot2` package specifically for the plotting of ternary diagrams. I have to use the `lines` dataframe for better visualization, and I plot the mean (`tweets_tern_mean`) bigger.


```r
library(ggtern)
library(viridis)

lines <- data.frame(x = c(1, 0, 0),
                    y = c(0, 1, 0),
                    z = c(0, 0, 1),
                    xend = c(0, 1, 1),
                    yend = c(1, 0, 1),
                    zend = c(1, 1, 0))

pyramid <- ggtern(data = tweets_tern, aes(x = replies, y = RTs, z = faves)) +
  geom_mask() +
  geom_point(col = ifelse(tweets_tern$replies/(tweets_tern$replies + tweets_tern$faves) > .5, 
                                viridis(5)[3], viridis(5)[1]),
             alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_point(data = tweets_tern_mean,
             aes(mean_replies, mean_rt, mean_fave),
             color = viridis(5)[1], alpha = 0.8, size = 5) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_segment(data = lines,
               aes(x, y, z,
                   xend = xend, yend = yend, zend = zend),
               color = "grey",
               size = .2) +
  theme_showarrows()

pyramid

I would have loved to present this ternary plot in an interactive fashion, with a tooltip to see every tweet, but I couldn't find a direct way to do it, so maybe next time I'll figure this out! In the meantime, I decided I could try a different approach to look at these tweets üòé

Apparently there are 4 out of the 123 with more replies than likes, let's explore them!

# Building Twitter Trees _√† la Lucy_ üëØ

As I said, I'm a fan of Lucy's post, so I'll plot the conversations that falls into _The Ratio_ rule in the form of a graph, to explore them as she did (with a few tweaks). Also, I'm a bit obsessed with graphs now that I took [James Curley](https://twitter.com/jalapic?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthorthe)'s ["Network Analysis in R" DataCamp course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/network-analysis-in-r), which is great! I use `igraph`, `ggraph` and `ggiraph` packages, the last one to make the graphs interactive .

I select the tweets first.


```r
tweets_tern_prop <- tweets_tern %>%
  arrange(desc(ratio)) %>%
  filter(ratio > .5)
```

then I loop over them to plot each twitter tree. Note that this is an interactive plot, the seed tweet is in a different color, and the size of the point is relative to the likes count.

Here are the tweets for us to take a proper look üéâ

A tweet about graphs, how timely üòÉ

Poeople doesn't seem angry at all in these replies, they look more like friendly conversations, just as I suspected üòé
