My favourite visualization about R-Ladies growth, using `gganimate` to produce this .gif file.

I recently came across [an article](http://spatial.ly/2017/03/mapping-5000-years-of-city-growth/) in which they map 5,000 years of city growth in a beautiful animation, and I knew I had to make a similar map for the [R-Ladies' chapters](https://rladies.org/) (probably the purple color they use had plenty to do with that ðŸ’œ ). So my idea was to map all the R-Ladies' chapters according to their size, and that's when I thought of using their Twitter followers as a way to estimate it, since it's the most extended social media we use (except for some chapters).

I decided to make 3 posts to go through the details of what I've done (especially for future me!):

1. [How to fetch Twitter users with R]({% post_url 2017-04-20-how-to-fetch-twitter-users-with-r %}): the title is kind of self explanatory...
2. [How to deal with ggplotly huge maps]({% post_url 2017-04-26-how-to-deal-with-ggplotly-huge-maps %}): where I go through the details of why I chose not to use `ggplotly` and use `plot_geo` instead to generate the HTML.
3. [How to plot animated maps with gganimate]({% post_url 2017-04-24-how-to-plot-animated-maps-with-gganimate %}): again, pretty obvious subject.

This is the visualization I liked the most, so I wanted to share it here...
