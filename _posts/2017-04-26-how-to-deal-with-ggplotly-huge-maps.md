description: How to produce interactive maps in R with plotly, using ggplotly and plot_geo. While ggplotly is easier to use, it produces huge HTML content. Using plot_geo instead is incredibly more efficient.
---
How I had to go from `gglotly` to `plotly::plot_geo` to reduce the size of the HTML output for posting interactive maps on my blog.

<!--more-->

This is the second one of the 3-posts-series, where I go from fetching Twitter users and preparing the data to visualizing it (If I wanted to show everything I've done in a single post, it would be almost as long as my first one! And believe me: nobody wants that üòù ):

1. [How to fetch Twitter users with R]({% post_url 2017-04-20-how-to-fetch-twitter-users-with-r %}): the title is kind of self explanatory...
2. How to deal with ggplotly huge maps: this one, where I go through the details of why I chose not to use `ggplotly` and use `plot_geo` instead to generate the HTML.
3. [How to plot animated maps with gganimate]({% post_url 2017-04-24-how-to-plot-animated-maps-with-gganimate %}): again, pretty obvious subject.
 
Finally [I present my favourite visualization here]({% post_url 2017-05-10-visualizing-r-ladies-growth %}).

## Motivation

For this series I've been experimenting with interactive maps and animated ones these past few days and I finally was able to produce some fancy outputs using the `plotly` package and the `gganimate` one. You can see the whole process [in my GitHub repo](https://github.com/d4tagirl/R-Ladies-growth-maps). Everything was working perfectly on RStudio, until I wanted to share my results on my blog, and _things got complicated_. Originally I produced some interactive maps using the `plotly::ggplotly` function and it generated a 3.3 MB HTML... and *that's an issue* when you want to include it on a website üò≥ . So I tried a different approach: using the `plotly::plot_geo` function I was able to produce a very similar plot, generating a way smaller HTML.

## The data

I'm using the [data produced in this previous post]({% post_url 2017-04-20-how-to-fetch-twitter-users-with-r %}). Let's take a look at it to see what we are dealing with.

This dataframe is about R-Ladies' chapters' Twitter accounts. I want to produce a `plotly` map where I can plot each chapter according to its location (`lon` and `lat`), with each point's size indicating its number of `followers`. 

## Using ggplotly

The first thing I did was generate the map using `ggplot2`, because `plotly` integrates easily with it with the `ggplotly` function. And I'm so comfortable using the `tidyverse`, that it was the natural thing for me to do! 

`ggplotly` translates the `ggplot2` object into a `plotly` one, displaying the aesthetic mappings in the tooltip. As I wanted to include other variables in it, I added the extra (and _unofficial_) `text` aesthetic for `ggplotly` to include them. As `ggplot2` doesn't have a `text` aesthetic it ignores it, but `ggplotly` recognizes it and displays it in the tooltip.

The greatest thing about the `text` aesthetic is that you can include more than one variable outside the `ggplot` aesthetics to display, as shown below.


```r
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(ggthemes)

world <- ggplot() +
  borders("world", colour = "gray85", fill = "gray80") +
  theme_map()

map <- world +
  geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat,
                 text = paste('city: ', location,
                              '<br /> created : ', created_at),
                 size = followers),
             data = rladies, colour = 'purple', alpha = .5) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 8), breaks = c(250, 500, 750, 1000)) +
  labs(size = 'Followers')
```

This is the static map that I'm animating using `ggplotly`, with the following code:


```r
library(plotly)

ggplotly(map, tooltip = c('text', 'size'))
```

If you want to see this map [you can check it out here]({% post_url 2017-04-24-huge-ggplotly-map %}){:target="_blank"}, but it will take a while! It is a 3.3 MB page (1.2 MB gzipped)!

It's a pretty nice map (and super easy to produce!), but it takes forever to load the HTML! And that is why I checked how the `plotly` people make this kind of plots from scratch, and I gave it a try.

It is actually pretty easy! The only thing that was not that straightforward for me was finding the chart references for customizing the maps (probably because I was doing a bad job at searching for them üò≥ ), so [here is the link](https://plot.ly/r/reference/), and for the layout in particular [here it is this other link](https://plot.ly/r/reference/#layout-geo/) just in case you encounter the same difficulties as I did.


```r
g <- list(showframe = FALSE,
          coastlinecolor = toRGB("white"),
          showland = TRUE,
          landcolor = toRGB("gray80"),
          showcountries = TRUE,
          countrycolor = toRGB("white"),
          countrywidth = 0.2,
          projection = list(type = 'Mercator'))

plot_geo(rladies,
         marker = list(color = toRGB("purple"),
                       opacity = 0.5,
                       line = list(color = toRGB("purple"),
                                   width = 1.5))) %>%
  add_markers(x = ~lon,
              y = ~lat,
              sizes = c(1, 450),
              size = ~followers,
              hoverinfo = "text",
              text = ~paste('city: ', location,
                            '<br /> created: ', created_at,
                            '<br /> followers: ', followers)) %>%
  layout(geo = g)
```
