&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/08/10/rstudio-conf-2019-diversity-scholarships/&#34;&gt;Applications for the rstudio::conf(2019) are now open&lt;/a&gt;! Last year I was lucky enough to be the receipient of an international diversity scholarships to attend
rstudio::conf(2018). It was hard to believe at first, but it was true!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in Uruguay, South America, so it&amp;rsquo;s extra expensive for me to attend R conferences that are mainly hosted far away from here. There is now a clear community effort in building a stronger latin american R community, take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://latin-r.com/&#34;&gt;LatinR 2018 in Argentina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.conectar2019.org/&#34;&gt;ConectaR 2019 in Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt;! But this was hardly the case in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/rstudio-conf-diversity-scholarships-for-the-win/2018-08-16-rstudio-conf-diversity-scholarships-for-the-win/mapContinentUru.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;float: center; width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-application&#34;&gt;The application&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time to apply for the scholarship, I was going through an &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t lose anything if I try&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; phase that led me to apply to all of the R conferences that I could, even when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t having any positive responses. It was pretty obvious to me that they could use the money to finance 3 or 4 people from around, instead of only me having greater impact! And I was at peace with that. But I wanted to know what it felt like to &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; the R community in person, a community I was being a part of for more than a year by then. So I tried one more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it is hard to express all your excitement and how you expect to impact your community with what you&amp;rsquo;ll learn in a couple of sentences&amp;hellip; Just in case you are looking for inspiration, you can check my application out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please briefly describe why you are good candidate for the diversity scholarship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I‚Äôm an economist who transitioned into Data Science a few years ago, in a country where most companies don‚Äôt yet know what Data Science is. I‚Äôm an R-Ladies Buenos Aires co-organizer and a NASA Datanaut (I love communities!), and as there wasn‚Äôt any Data Science community in Uruguay, I started R-Ladies Montevideo (our first meetup will be next week!) ‚ò∫ I also have a blog where I try to combine posts in English and Spanish, to reach more people (there are not as many resources in Spanish as I would like) and share what I think will help others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you want to get out of rstudio::conf?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition of learning a lot of cool stuff, I am looking forward to meeting all these amazing people in the R community. I am in touch with a lot of them through Twitter and Slack on a daily basis, especially R-Ladies, and it would be awesome to finally get to know many of them. I want to gather the experience of other communities so I can be a better host and make the most of R-Ladies Montevideo and Buenos Aires‚Äô communities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are still not sure, you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSck8FBjNWjziI8pPIoCBlf5J4oQ_6pzeUdbQ1HjYfJ2bNDwDw/viewform&#34;&gt;request an application review to the &lt;em&gt;R-Ladies Abstract/Scholarship Review Program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lead by the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jent103&#34;&gt;Jennifer Thompson&lt;/a&gt; for all the R-Ladies out there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-the-scholarship&#34;&gt;About the scholarship&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scholarship covered the admission to both the conference and a training session (workshop) of my choice, as well as $3,000 towards our other related expenses like flight and hotel. Since breakfast, lunch and breaks were provided daily, it basically covered all my expenses. I found a good deal on my flight and the rest was enough for me to book a room at the conference hotel (that came with a regular visitor as you can see in the pic), so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to pay for anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/rstudio-conf-diversity-scholarships-for-the-win/2018-08-16-rstudio-conf-diversity-scholarships-for-the-win/room_with_a_view.JPG&#34; style=&#34;float: center; width: 40%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RStudio offered to put us in touch with other like-minded scholarship recipient so we could share a room. That&amp;rsquo;s a great opportunity to meet new people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne Carome was my point of contact and she was great! Very supportive and taking care of every detail!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-the-conference&#34;&gt;About the conference&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RStudio::conf(2018) took place in San Diego, California, January 31-Feb 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference for me started two days earlier, with the 2 days workshop (to choose from a total of 11 ones aimed to both beginners and experts) to go deeper into a topic. It is a great opportunity to learn some techniques from really amazing Teachers and TAs (some times you even learn how to use a package from its creators or contributors, which is pretty awesome!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keynote speakers were &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/visnut&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dianne Cook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúTo the Tidyverse and Beyond: Challenges for the Future in Data Science‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fly_upside_down&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;JJ Allaire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúMachine Learning with R and TensorFlow‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;. There were 2 fireside chats: a &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tidyverse discussion&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jenny Bryan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/minebocek&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mine √áetinkaya-Rundel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/topepos&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Max Kuhn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hadleywickham&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hadley Wickham&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, were &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dataandme&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mara Averick&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the moderator. And a &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;R in industry discussion&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/earino&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eduardo Ari√±o de la Rubia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tanyacash21&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tanya Cashorali&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ericcolson&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eric Colson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/eamcvey?lang=es&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elaine McVey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/drob&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Robinson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tareefk&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tareef Kawaf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the moderator. There were also over 60 great 15 minutes talks, divided into 3 simultaneous tracks. You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3105/&#34;&gt;check the full conference schedule here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2018&#34;&gt;all the videos here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could enjoy an &lt;em&gt;R-Ladies&amp;rsquo; Birds of a Feather&lt;/em&gt; session, where we had the opportunity to meet and greet with all the R-Ladies, and spread the love üíú It was the perfect ocassion to take a pic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/rstudio-conf-diversity-scholarships-for-the-win/2018-08-16-rstudio-conf-diversity-scholarships-for-the-win/rladies.JPG&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 2 parties involved (more on that next!). The first one was at the hotel pool, where there was some balloons and a book signing involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/rstudio-conf-diversity-scholarships-for-the-win/2018-08-16-rstudio-conf-diversity-scholarships-for-the-win/pool.JPG&#34; style=&#34;width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/rstudio-conf-diversity-scholarships-for-the-win/2018-08-16-rstudio-conf-diversity-scholarships-for-the-win/booksigning.JPG&#34; style=&#34;width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other was a rooftop party at the Hard Rock Hotel ü§ò&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-the-r-community&#34;&gt;About the R community&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly one of the things I enjoyed the most about the conference was meeting people. I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat active in the R community on Twitter and on the R-Ladies Slack, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never had the opportunity to meet the community in person (with a few exceptions). I can endorse now what is widely spread about the R community being extremely friendly and welcoming to new folks. I felt at home immediately and &lt;em&gt;Twitter friends&lt;/em&gt; were coming to say hi as soon as they saw me :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first contact with the community was with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gdequeiroz?lang=es&#34;&gt;Gaby&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of R-Ladies. I have had met her before, and everytime we meet is like we could spend hours talking :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/rstudio-conf-diversity-scholarships-for-the-win/2018-08-16-rstudio-conf-diversity-scholarships-for-the-win/gaby.JPG&#34; style=&#34;width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pageinini&#34;&gt;Page Piccinini&lt;/a&gt; kindly organized an R-Ladies San Diego Meetup, where Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan gave talks and we had some time to meet and chat with many R-Ladies and allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Thanks so much to everyone who came out tonight! &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/RLadies?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#RLadies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/classy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@classy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/3Nje42i8vf&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/3Nje42i8vf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; R-Ladies San Diego (@RLadiesSanDiego) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RLadiesSanDiego/status/958562941346889728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;January 31, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was plenty of time to chat and get involved with the community throughout the conference, during breakfast, lunch and breaks, but also between sessions and at the many social events like the bof sessions and parties. RStudio made sure of that, as well as the very friendly and welcoming R community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some pics from the event; you can find &lt;a href=&#34;https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNjtVVjtcMtz3MWQkgsRO8NqlOlvGZ7kNkdUHJ1qWe_AiLn8F-PlKk5Qmq1PWaG1A?key=d1NoeDVBUnJMU2tZVzFOaV9odjVJbFF4UmQ5cW9n&#34;&gt;some beautiful ones here&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cmastication&#34;&gt;JD Long&lt;/a&gt; took and shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up having a short roadtrip with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cantoflor_87&#34;&gt;Flor&lt;/a&gt;, another international scholarship recipient from Buenos Aires, Argentina, that was the beggining of a beautiful frienship :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-end&#34;&gt;The end&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was time to go home, but after that I felt a completely different connection with the community. And we now have this tweet :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rstudio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@rstudio&lt;/a&gt;::conf(&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rladies?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rladies&lt;/a&gt;) %&amp;gt;%&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/d4tagirl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@d4tagirl&lt;/a&gt;::üì∏ %&amp;gt;%&lt;br&gt;  üé©‚ú®::image_annotate(&amp;quot;R-Ladies at rstudio::conf&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;                         size = 500, gravity = &amp;quot;north&amp;quot;, &lt;br&gt;                         color = üíú,&lt;br&gt;                         boxcolor = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%&lt;br&gt;  üé©‚ú®::image_border( üíú,&amp;quot;200x200&amp;quot;) &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/IFDNXrVoc8&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/IFDNXrVoc8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; R-Ladies Global (@RLadiesGlobal) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal/status/959707423111024641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;February 3, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say: I encourage anyone interested in R to attend this conference. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll go again as soon as I can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I was contacted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://gmerchant.ucsd.edu/&#34;&gt;Gina Merchant&lt;/a&gt; about being interviewed for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/groups/163371137549666&#34;&gt;R-Forwards&amp;rsquo; Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &amp;lsquo;Who we are!&amp;rsquo; series. The series asks R users about how they started coding, and how they got to where they are today. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure I would have much to say until I realized my interview could help encourage people, as &lt;a href=&#34;/2017/01/the-r-ladies-way/&#34;&gt;my older post about how the R-Ladies community welcomed me&lt;/a&gt; did (I know of at least one R-Lady who reached out to us thanks to this post and I&amp;rsquo;m so proud of that üíÅ ). Also, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hookedondata.org/building-your-data-science-network-reaching-out/&#34;&gt;Emily Robinson&amp;rsquo;s latest two-part blog post&lt;/a&gt; (which I highly recommend) led me to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fast.ai/2017/12/18/personal-brand/&#34;&gt;this Rachel Thomas&amp;rsquo; blog post about &lt;em&gt;personal branding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where she stated: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;[&amp;hellip;] remember that your target audience is you-6-months-ago [&amp;hellip;]. You are best positioned to help people one step behind you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. And I decided to go for it! I&amp;rsquo;m even making this public post here to reach even more people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/r-forwards-who-we-are-series/2018-01-13-r-forwards-who-we-are-series/forwards.png&#34; width=&#34;120&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://forwards.github.io/about/&#34;&gt;R-Forward&lt;/a&gt; advocates for and encourages women and other under-represented groups to engage in the R community. Quoting them from their about page, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The R Forwards Taskforce addresses the underrepresentation of women and other groups such as LGBT, minority ethnic groups, and people with disabilities in the R community. Task force members are diverse not only in their identities but also in their R proficiency, work contexts, and career stages.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Facebook group is a very inclusive one that can be great if you are looking for a supportive group to encourage you while you navigate through your R journey. You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/groups/163371137549666&#34;&gt;request access to the group here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?user_id=114258616&#34;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; if you prefer. The group is currently looking for moderators to include more geographic and user-skill diversity, so this can be a great opportunity to get more involved too üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gina was really nice and I totally enjoyed the process. The questions were well thought out and I had the opportunity to read everything and comment before it was published. Also, there is a great vibe in the way she expressed what we covered in our talk that I love. I&amp;rsquo;m deeply thankful to her. If you want to share your experience, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/drgmerchant?lang=en&#34;&gt;please reach out to her&lt;/a&gt;. The only requirement is that you take a selfie with R , so here it is mine (not really a selfie, but still&amp;hellip;) üíÅ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/r-forwards-who-we-are-series/2018-01-13-r-forwards-who-we-are-series/fb_pic.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here it is. I hope you enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: Cross-posted with the R-Forwards Facebook closed group)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;who-we-are&#34;&gt;WHO WE ARE!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our second installation of the Who We Are series, I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce Daniela V√°zquez Leggiadro. She was kind enough to share her R background and experiences with the group. Thank you Daniela!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Months/years as R user:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7 years. She started in 2010 as an undergrad (because her professors said ‚Äúwe have to do this in R.‚Äù). But Daniela has been a daily user for the past 5 years, beginning with her first job as analytics consultant at Equifax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data science isn‚Äôt a broadly known discipline where Daniela lives in Uruguay. She works as a Data Scientist at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.idatha.com/&#34;&gt;Idatha&lt;/a&gt; on a variety of projects. She works mostly with engineers, and her statistical and economics background gives her a unique perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quote:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt confident [with R] at first. I quit my job last September to get better at R and data science. So I‚Äôd like to share a few tips - especially for someone in a country that doesn‚Äôt have as many resources (we are just 3 million in Uruguay; and half of us are in the capital). I grew my pool of resources by reaching out through social media. I am (or was?) kind of shy but with time, I learned how to slowly develop relationships with people that I don‚Äôt know in person. These contacts are essential to anyone, knowing that you have people that you can reach out to, that want to help you. These relationships guide me to understand how to study, what to study. Being part of the community has been wonderful. I was out of a job for about 10 months, which is scary, but now, I‚Äôm at my new job, and it‚Äôs just been 1 month but I know this is where I am meant to be. And I want to tell others that if you work hard, you will make it. &lt;strong&gt;You can do it&lt;/strong&gt;.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun facts about Daniela:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) She is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.nasa.gov/blog/welcome-datanauts-2017-spring-class/&#34;&gt;member of the 2017 Spring NASA Datanaut class&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) She recently co-founded the Montevideo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladies.org&#34;&gt;R-Ladies&lt;/a&gt; chapter in Uruguay. But she started in Buenos Aires - also as a cofounder. She took a boat for 3 hours to get there! The first R-Ladies‚Äô Buenos Aires meetup was 25 ladies, and now it is a huge community!
&lt;em&gt;Interviewee note: If you have questions about starting an R-Ladies meetup, Daniela is a great resource!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you could tell your pre-R using self one thing about learning the language, what would it be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with the &lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt;. This is probably the best advice to give to anyone according to my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you use R for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data wrangling, visualization, machine learning and NLP mostly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your favorite packages and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends on what I‚Äôm playing with at the moment. Recently &lt;code&gt;gganimate&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, Daniela made &lt;a href=&#34;/2017/05/how-to-plot-animated-maps-with-gganimate/&#34;&gt;a GIF showing the growth of R Ladies&lt;/a&gt;. She started using the &lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt; a little more than a year ago, and her life has forever changed! &lt;code&gt;tidytext&lt;/code&gt; is on her favorites list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Updating the üó∫ for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RLadiesMVD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@RLadiesMVD&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s kickoff on Wednesday: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/RLadies?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#RLadies&lt;/a&gt; keeps growing üéâ Now &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/LatAm?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#LatAm&lt;/a&gt; is turning purple too üíú &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/FY2TaOUdJa&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/FY2TaOUdJa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Daniela V√°zquez (@d4tagirl) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/d4tagirl/status/902130856260771842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;August 28, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What resources do you use when you get stuck?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow. Also uses R-Ladies channel in Slack called R Help. Both in global Slack and in her specific chapters. Sometimes Twitter - using #rstats (mostly for general or conceptual questions). And now we have the &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.rstudio.com/&#34;&gt;brand new RStudio Community&lt;/a&gt; that seems great and promises to be very friendly to newcomers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you aspire to learn in R?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exposure to others has expanded her horizons, and she wants to keep up! Recent example is `tidytext: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tidytextmining.com/nasa.html&#34;&gt;Julia Silge analyzes NASA‚Äôs datasets&lt;/a&gt;, counting co-occurence, and making a beautiful plot (a net). People expose you to things you didn‚Äôt know you wanted to be able to do!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The R-Ladies way!</title>
      <link>/2017/01/the-r-ladies-way/</link>

      <guid>/2017/01/the-r-ladies-way/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;4 months ago I handed my notice in one of the boldest moves in my entire career. Not that I visualized myself as a get-a-job-for-the-rest-of-your-life kind of girl (at all), but I&amp;rsquo;ve always been very cautious, thinking a couple of moves ahead. About a year ago I was in a very nice and stable position at Equifax as an Analytics Consultant, mostly building bespoke Credit Score Models, and the feeling that I needed to make a change started growing on me: I was not challenged enough and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t finding any way to motivate myself. I had to move on. I started my quest for a job, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay&#34;&gt;Uruguay (where I live)&lt;/a&gt; is a really small country where Data Science positions are not that common, so the few thing that came out didn&amp;rsquo;t lead anywhere. I decided I had to quit anyway to see if I could find my joy again and continue my journey to become a Data Scientist. And I did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny (and terrifying) thing was that I had no idea what to do next. Try to explain to your parents that you are trying to &lt;em&gt;find yourself&lt;/em&gt; at the age of 33&amp;hellip; not that easy! The only plan I had was to focus on sharpening my skills and embracing uncertainty (not that I had any alternative for the latter!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a couple of weeks to cool off and then I started looking around to see what was going on in the R community. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using R since my University years, but I never got involved in the community. My strategy was to start following some interesting people on Twitter (I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember how I knew who to follow) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.r-bloggers.com/&#34;&gt;R-Bloggers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;doing things&lt;/em&gt; that seemed somehow useful of fulfilling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helping &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/BetaAndBit/ComicBooks/blob/master/es_la/HeavyDog_es_la.pdf&#34;&gt;translate to Spanish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/BetaAndBit/ComicBooks/blob/master/en/HeavyDog_en.pdf&#34;&gt;a comic introducing R for high school students&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discovering and applying for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/&#34;&gt;NASA Datanauts 2017 program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;taking a Machine Learning class at the MS University program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning how to solve a Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube (wait, I just Googled it! and I have always wanted to learn how to do that, so don&amp;rsquo;t judge&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I worked hard and followed my gut something would come up, and even if it didn&amp;rsquo;t I would be trying things and having a great time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow I came across some R-Ladies&amp;rsquo; tweets, and started taking an interest on them. It turned out a lot of these inspiring people I was following on Twitter were related to this organization, so it was definitely &lt;em&gt;a big deal&lt;/em&gt;. That is exactly why I felt like I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have a place there: they would probably had everything worked out by then (which they had) and I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I could have anything to contribute (&lt;em&gt;this was my first mistake&lt;/em&gt;). Looking for a Uruguayan chapter to attend their meetups, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any (told you, very little country). My second best shot was Argentina, a country 12 times bigger than mine and only a 3 hours ferry ride from home, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any chapters there either. So I stayed put (&lt;em&gt;second bad judgement call&lt;/em&gt;). I&amp;rsquo;ve always been shy when it came to speaking my mind if I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anyone, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the courage to speak up and engage in that community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first days of January they announced the R-Ladies Buenos Aires chapter (Argentina, yay!), a great way to start my I-have-no-idea-what-to-expect year! And this time I joined &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/rladies-buenos-aires/&#34;&gt;their Meetup account&lt;/a&gt; as one of the participants. I told them about my situation and in two days I was already co-organizing the Buenos Aires chapter with these two amazing ladies I had never met (&lt;em&gt;now I was starting to get things right!&lt;/em&gt;). I was already feeling included and I immediately found things I could contribute with, no matter how little those things seemed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to figure out how I could help the Buenos Aires chapter, I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how things worked. And something new happened to me: &lt;em&gt;I was not afraid to ask&lt;/em&gt;. It was the first time I was not afraid to say something wrong, to ask something obvious or simply to be ridiculed. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know if this was a gender related effect, but these ladies were all so welcoming that I never felt out of place. More like the opposite!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was already thinking about starting a blog, and the feeling that I was &lt;em&gt;one of them&lt;/em&gt; certainly gave me the extra push I needed. As I&amp;rsquo;m not a native English speaker I had this additional preocupation. Before I announced &lt;a href=&#34;/2017/01/rpart-who-voted-for-trump/&#34;&gt;my first blog post&lt;/a&gt; I had several R-Ladies&amp;rsquo; suggestions. People I had never expected to contact me were giving me feedback, and they were like celebrities to me! By the time it was public I felt a lot more secure and relaxed to enjoy it :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things started to work out for me: I got accepted to join the &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.nasa.gov/blog/welcome-datanauts-2017-spring-class/&#34;&gt;NASA Datanauts 2017 Spring Class&lt;/a&gt; (turned out it was an R-Lady&amp;rsquo;s tweet I saw that encouraged me to apply) and I even answered a few Stack Overflow questions! This was the exact kind of confidence boost I needed! I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to getting an amazing job!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say here is: whether there is a chapter in your city or not, no matter how shy you are, there is an amazing group of ladies ready to give you the support you need to reach your true potential. And some of them are probably in a situation similar to yours, so it is also a place for sharing experiences and not feeling lonely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you still on the fence? You can:&lt;/p&gt;
