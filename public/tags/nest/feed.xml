      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I learned about nested dataframes to estimate different models across different groups of observations. Actually it was when I took David Robinson&amp;rsquo;s Datacamp course: Exploratory Data Analysis in R: Case Study and I found it really useful! The other day I was listening to the 31st episode of the Not So Standard Deviations when Hilary started talking about nested dataframes and how it could be not completely straightforward for everyone to appreciate how useful this could be.</description>
